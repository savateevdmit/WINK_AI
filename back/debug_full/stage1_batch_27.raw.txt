<|channel|>analysis<|message|>We need to analyze each sentence for labels. Provide JSON with scene_results array. Each scene has scID and snt array of objects with id and vlc array of label/conf pairs.

We must assign at least one label per scene. If all sentences are neutral, assign MILD_CONFLICT to most contextually active sentence. Here we have violence: Oleg pulls a bat (биту) and uses it, threatens. There's a physical confrontation. So we can label some sentences with WEAPONS_USAGE or MURDER_HOMICIDE? It's not murder but threat. Also maybe VIOLENCE_NON_GRAPHIC. Also maybe DANGEROUS_IMITABLE_ACTS. Let's see.

Sentences:

0: "Катя за столом, задумчивая." neutral.

1: "Олег наливает себе пиво." neutral.

2: "Ну чё, давай за нас, чтоб всё всегда и ни копейкой меньше..." neutral.

3: "Олег отпивает пиво." neutral.

4: "Раздается шум в прихожей." neutral.

5: "Олег быстро вынимает из-за тумбочки биту." This is weapon acquisition. Label WEAPONS_MENTION? Actually "вынимает" indicates possession. Could label WEAPONS_USAGE? It's not used yet. But we can label WEAPONS_MENTION or WEAPONS_USAGE. Allowed labels include WEAPONS_USAGE, WEAPONS_MENTION. Use WEAPONS_USAGE maybe.

6: "Катя настороженно выглядывает в прихожую." neutral.

7: "Там Алёна и Артур. алёна Ма, это мы." neutral.

8: "Здрасьте, тёть Кать." neutral.

9: "Алёна и Артур наощупь проходят в комнату Алёны. катя (Олегу) Зачем ты это сюда притащил? олег Да мало ли чё..." This includes question about weapon. Could label MURDER_HOMICIDE? No. Maybe WEAPONS_USAGE or MILD_CONFLICT.

10: "Так спокойнее." neutral.

11: "Ты это из-за Жени?" neutral.

12: "Да при чём здесь твой..." neutral.

13: "Так, просто, на всякий пожарный." neutral.

14: "- оценка." neutral.

15: "Прихожая." neutral.

16: "Резко распахивается дверь." neutral.

17: "На пороге Инофемёнов." neutral.

18: "Инофемёнов" neutral.

19: "Где ты?!" neutral.

20: "Кухня." neutral.

21: "Олег принимает мужественный вид, выходит с битой в прихожую." This is threat. Label WEAPONS_USAGE, MURDER_HOMICIDE? It's not murder but threat. Use WEAPONS_USAGE and maybe MILD_CONFLICT.

22: "Прихожая." neutral.

23: "Ну здесь я, чё-то хотел?" neutral.

24: "Инофемёнов Не ты!" neutral.

25: "Ты мне вообще неинтересен." neutral.

26: "Ты чё, фуфел, вообще края попутал?" neutral.

27: "Олег замахивается битой на Инофемёнов." This is direct threat. Label WEAPONS_USAGE, MURDER_HOMICIDE? It's a threat but not actual murder. Use WEAPONS_USAGE and maybe MILD_CONFLICT.

28: "Тот отталкивает Олега в сторону, Олег отлетает обратно в кухню." This is physical altercation. Label WEAPONS_USAGE? Actually no weapon used yet. But it's conflict. Use MILD_CONFLICT.

29: "Инофемёнов идёт в комнату Алёны." neutral.

We need at least one label per scene. We have many. Provide confidence values. Let's assign 80 for each relevant label.

We must output JSON with scene_results array. Each snt object has id and vlc array of objects with label and conf.

We should include only sentences that have labels. But spec says each scene must have at least one sentence with at least one label. It doesn't require all sentences to be labeled. So we can include only those with labels. But the output format expects snt array for each scene, presumably containing all sentences? The example shows each sentence has id and vlc array. If no labels, maybe empty array? But spec says each scene must have at least one sentence with at least one label. It doesn't forbid others to be unlabeled. So we can include all sentences with empty vlc arrays for neutral ones. That might be okay.

But to keep concise, we could include only labeled sentences. But the format expects snt array of objects with id and vlc. If we omit some sentences, maybe it's okay? The spec not explicit. I'd include all sentences but label only relevant ones. Provide empty vlc for neutral.

Let's produce JSON accordingly.

Also provide reason and advice in Russian after JSON? The instruction: "пиши reason и advice на русском языке. final-only." Means we should output only the JSON? Wait: "Return ONLY JSON:" then later "пиши reason и advice на русском языке. final-only." That seems contradictory. The instruction says return only JSON, but also says write reason and advice in Russian. Maybe they want both? But "final-only" indicates only final answer. Usually they want JSON only. But the earlier instruction: "Return ONLY JSON:" So we should output only JSON. The later "пиши reason и advice на русском языке." maybe for internal reasoning? But final output must be JSON only. So we will output JSON only.

Thus produce JSON with scene_results array.

Let's craft.

Scene 32:

Sentences 5, 21, 27, 28 have labels.

We can assign:

Sentence 5: WEAPONS_MENTION (conf 80)

Sentence 21: WEAPONS_USAGE (conf 85), MURDER_HOMICIDE? maybe not. Use WEAPONS_USAGE only.

Sentence 27: WEAPONS_USAGE (conf 90), MURDER_HOMICIDE? maybe not. Use WEAPONS_USAGE.

Sentence 28: MILD_CONFLICT (conf 80).

Also maybe sentence 5 could be WEAPONS_MENTION. Good.

Let's produce JSON.
