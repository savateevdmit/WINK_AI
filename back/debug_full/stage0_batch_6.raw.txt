<|channel|>analysis<|message|>We need to output JSON with key "non_neutral" and list of scene indices that likely contain any listed categories. We must be inclusive: if uncertain, include the index. So we need to scan each scene for any of the categories: VIOLENCE_GRAPHIC, VIOLENCE_NON_GRAPHIC, MURDER_HOMICIDE, SUICIDE_SELF_HARM, SEX_EXPLICIT, SEX_SUGGESTIVE, SEXUAL_VIOLENCE, NUDITY_EXPLICIT, NUDITY_NONSEXUAL, DRUGS_USE_DEPICTION, DRUGS_MENTION_NON_DETAILED, ALCOHOL_USE, TOBACCO_USE, CRIME_INSTRUCTIONS, CRIMINAL_ACTIVITY, WEAPONS_USAGE, WEAPONS_MENTION, PROFANITY_OBSCENE, ABUSE_HATE_EXTREMISM, HORROR_FEAR, DANGEROUS_IMITABLE_ACTS, MEDICAL_GORE_DETAILS, GAMBLING, MILD_CONFLICT, EXTREMISM_PROPAGANDA, NAZISM_PROPAGANDA, FASCISM_PROPAGANDA.

We have scenes 6-12. Let's examine each.

Scene 6: It's about a circus, kids, a talking crow, theft of museum. No violence described. There's mention of "обокрал музей" (robbed museum). That's criminal activity. So category CRIMINAL_ACTIVITY. Also maybe MILD_CONFLICT? Not violent. So include index 6.

Scene 7: They are sneaking under a net, but no violence. There's mention of "поймают". No weapons. So maybe MILD_CONFLICT? It's just risk. But we can be inclusive: include 7.

Scene 8: They climb onto a trailer roof. No violence. Maybe DANGEROUS_IMITABLE_ACTS? Climbing could be dangerous but not imitable? It's a stunt. Might be considered DANGEROUS_IMITABLE_ACTS. But we can include 8.

Scene 9: They see a crow in a cage, photos of museum, etc. No violence. So maybe none. But we might include 9 if uncertain? The instruction says inclusive: if uncertain, include the index. There's no explicit category. But maybe MILD_CONFLICT? Not really. I'd lean to not include 9. But to be safe, maybe include 9? Let's think: The scene includes "Варя фоткает билет в музей, лежащий на столе." No violence. So maybe not.

Scene 10: They meet a fakir, no violence. So maybe none.

Scene 11: Meditation, cow, nothing. So none.

Thus likely indices: 6,7,8. Maybe 9? But we can be inclusive: uncertain. There's no explicit category but maybe "MILD_CONFLICT" because they are investigating theft. But it's not conflict. I'd include 9 as uncertain? The instruction: "Be INCLUSIVE: if uncertain, include the index." So if uncertain whether any category present, include it. For scene 9, I'm uncertain if there's any category. There's no violence or crime mention. It's just investigation. But maybe "CRIMINAL_ACTIVITY" because they are investigating theft. But it's not direct. I'd lean to include 9 as uncertain. But we can decide.

Let's check categories: CRIME_INSTRUCTIONS? No instructions. CRIMINAL_ACTIVITY? They are investigating theft, but not committing. Might still be considered criminal activity? It's about theft. But they are not committing. So maybe not.

But the instruction says "any listed categories." So if any category present, include. If uncertain, include. For scene 9, I'm uncertain. I'd include it to be safe.

Scene 10: no categories. Scene 11: none. So final list: [6,7,8,9].

Return JSON: {"non_neutral":[6,7,8,9]}.<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>{"non_neutral":[6,7,8,9]}
