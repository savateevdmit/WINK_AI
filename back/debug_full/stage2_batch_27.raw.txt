<|channel|>analysis<|message|>We need to produce JSON with ans array. For each input, we produce det objects for each label in vlc. We must use allowed labels exactly. Allowed labels? Provided earlier: "PROFANITY_OBSCENE", "VIOLENCE_GRAPHIC", "VIOLENCE_NON_GRAPHIC", "MURDER_HOMICIDE", "SEX_EXPLICIT", "SEX_SUGGESTIVE", "DRUGS_USE_DEPICTION", "DRUGS_MENTION_NON_DETAILED", "ALCOHOL_USE", "TOBACCO_USE", "HORROR_FEAR", "ABUSE_HATE_EXTREMISM", "CRIME_INSTRUCTIONS", "WEAPONS_USAGE", "WEAPONS_MENTION", "MEDICAL_GORE_DETAILS", "NUDITY_EXPLICIT", "NUDITY_NONSEXUAL", "GAMBLING", "MILD_CONFLICT", "DANGEROUS_IMITABLE_ACTS", "SUICIDE_SELF_HARM", "CRIMINAL_ACTIVITY", "EXTREMISM_PROPAGANDA", "NAZISM_PROPAGANDA", "FASCISM_PROPAGANDA". Also maybe others? But we only need those present in vlc.

We must compute severity and score. Use bs base scores, then mod adjustments. For each label, we compute base score from fw.bs. Then apply mods: many, gore, off, condemn, warn, glorify, instr. But we don't know which mods apply. We need to interpret context. For each sentence, we decide if the content is mild, moderate, severe. Use bs + mods? The instruction: "sev from th; scr from bs (+/- brief rationale)." So severity derived from threshold mapping of score? Wait: "sev from th; scr from bs (+/- brief rationale)." Means severity classification based on score thresholds defined in fw.th. Score is base score plus modifications? They say scr from bs (+/- brief rationale). So we compute score = base score + adjustments. Then severity category determined by thresholds.

We need to produce for each label: label, sev, scr, rsn, adv, ok, suggest.

Ok boolean indicates if content is acceptable? We need to decide if ok false then suggest alternative. For example, for SEX_SUGGESTIVE maybe ok true? But we might consider that it's mild? Let's interpret: The policy likely allows some sexual suggestive content but not explicit. So SEX_SUGGESTIVE may be allowed (ok true). But we still provide severity and score.

For WEAPONS_USAGE and VIOLENCE_NON_GRAPHIC: This is a non-graphic violence with weapon usage. Base scores: WEAPONS_USAGE 55, VIOLENCE_NON_GRAPHIC 40. Mods? Possibly "many" or "gore"? Not gore. "off" maybe? Not sure. We might not apply mods. So score = 55+40=95? But we need to consider that these are separate labels; each label gets its own score. Actually each label has its own base score. For WEAPONS_USAGE, base 55. For VIOLENCE_NON_GRAPHIC, base 40. We might not add them. So each label's score is just base. Then severity: 55 => Severe (since >80? Wait thresholds: None 0-24, Mild 25-49, Moderate 50-79, Severe 80-100). 55 falls into Moderate. 40 falls into Mild. But we might also consider that combined content may be more severe. But spec says for each label produce det object. So we compute individually.

But we also need to provide rsn (reason) and adv (advice) in Russian. Provide brief rationale for score. For ok: if content is allowed? For SEX_SUGGESTIVE likely ok true. For WEAPONS_USAGE maybe ok false? But policy may allow non-graphic violence with weapons? Might be allowed but we need to check. The policy says "Violence Non-Graphic" is allowed? Not sure. But we can set ok true for mild content. But if it's weapon usage, maybe still ok? The policy might allow depiction of weapons but not instructions. So ok true.

But we also need to consider "CRIME_INSTRUCTIONS" etc. Not present.

We need to produce JSON with ans array containing objects for each input. Each object has scID, id, det array.

Let's compute for each:

Input 1: scID 25, id 0, vlc ["SEX_SUGGESTIVE"]. Base score 60. Severity: 60 => Moderate. Score 60. Reason: "Содержит сексуально-намёки без явного описания". Advice: "Можно оставить, но избегать излишней намёков".

Ok true.

Input 2: scID 25, id 6, vlc ["SEX_SUGGESTIVE"]. Same as above. Score 60, moderate. Ok true.

Input 3: scID 26, id 7, vlc ["WEAPONS_USAGE", "VIOLENCE_NON_GRAPHIC"].

For WEAPONS_USAGE: base 55 => Moderate. Reason: "Показано использование оружия (перцовый баллончик) без графических деталей". Advice: "Можно оставить, но убедитесь, что не пропагандируется насилие". Ok true.

For VIOLENCE_NON_GRAPHIC: base 40 => Mild. Reason: "Нарушение без крови/графики". Advice: "Можно оставить, но избегать излишней агрессии". Ok true.

But we might also consider that the combination of weapon usage and violence may increase severity? But spec says each label separately.

Also we need to include "suggest" field. For ok true, suggest null. For ok false, provide suggestion string like "DRUGS_MENTION_NON_DETAILED/REMOVE". Not needed here.

Thus produce JSON accordingly.

We must ensure JSON format exactly: {"ans":[{...}]}.

Let's craft.

Also we need to include "det" array with objects for each label.

Each det object: {"label":"SEX_SUGGESTIVE","sev":"Moderate","scr":60,"rsn":"Содержит сексуально-намёки без явного описания","adv":"Можно оставить, но избегать излишних намёков","ok":true,"suggest":null}

Similarly for others.

Let's produce final JSON.<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>{"ans":[{"scID":25,"id":0,"det":[{"label":"SEX_SUGGESTIVE","sev":"Moderate","scr":60,"rsn":"Содержит сексуально-намёки без явного описания","adv":"Можно оставить, но избегать излишних намёков","ok":true,"suggest":null}]},"scID":25,"id":6,"det":[{"label":"SEX_SUGGESTIVE","sev":"Moderate","scr":60,"rsn":"Содержит сексуально-намёки без явного описания","adv":"Можно оставить, но избегать излишних намёков","ok":true,"suggest":null}]},"scID":26,"id":7,"det":[{"label":"WEAPONS_USAGE","sev":"Moderate","scr":55,"rsn":"Показано использование оружия (перцовый баллончик) без графических деталей","adv":"Можно оставить, но убедитесь, что не пропагандируется насилие","ok":true,"suggest":null},{"label":"VIOLENCE_NON_GRAPHIC","sev":"Mild","scr":40,"rsn":"Нарушение без крови/графики","adv":"Можно оставить, но избегать излишней агрессии","ok":true,"suggest":null}]}]}
