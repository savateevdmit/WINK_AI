<|channel|>analysis<|message|>We need to analyze each sentence for labels. Provide JSON with scene_results array. Each scene has scID and snt array of objects with id and vlc array of label/conf pairs.

We must assign at least one label per scene. If all sentences are neutral, assign MILD_CONFLICT to most contextually active sentence. But here there are violent actions: Oleg thrown from balcony, mention of "вырубился от перцового баллончика" (maybe non-graphic). There's a mention of "выбросил" but not gore. There's mention of "потеря" etc. Also mention of "потеря" maybe violence. Also mention of "выбросил" from balcony is violent. Also mention of "вырубился" (fainted). There's also mention of "потеря" maybe not. There's mention of "выбросил" Oleg from balcony: that's a violent act, possibly MURDER_HOMICIDE? It's an attempt or commission? He threw Oleg from balcony; that could be homicide attempt. So label MURDER_HOMICIDE.

Also mention of "перцовый баллончик" (pepper spray) is non-graphic violence. So VIOLENCE_NON_GRAPHIC.

Also mention of "потеря" maybe not. There's also mention of "выбросил" Oleg from balcony: that's violent. Also mention of "вырубился" from pepper spray: non-graphic.

Ok.

Also mention of "выбросил" Oleg from balcony: that's violent. So MURDER_HOMICIDE.

Also mention of "перцовый баллончик" is VIOLENCE_NON_GRAPHIC.

Also mention of "выбросил" Oleg from balcony: maybe also WEAPONS_USAGE? Not exactly a weapon, but it's an act of violence. But we can label MURDER_HOMICIDE.

Also mention of "потеря" maybe not.

Also mention of "потеря" maybe not.

Also mention of "выбросил" Oleg from balcony: maybe also CRIMINAL_ACTIVITY? It's a violent crime. But we can use MURDER_HOMICIDE.

Also mention of "перцовый баллончик" is a weapon, but it's a chemical weapon. So WEAPONS_USAGE maybe. But we can include both.

Also mention of "выбросил" Oleg from balcony: also could be CRIME_INSTRUCTIONS? Not instructions. So not.

Also mention of "потеря" maybe not.

Also mention of "выбросил" Oleg from balcony: also could be WEAPONS_USAGE? It's a physical act, but no weapon. So maybe not.

Ok.

Stop repeating.

Now other sentences: There's mention of "потеря" maybe not.

Also mention of "выбросил" Oleg from balcony: MURDER_HOMICIDE.

Also mention of "перцовый баллончик": VIOLENCE_NON_GRAPHIC, WEAPONS_USAGE.

Also mention of "выбросил" Oleg from balcony: MURDER_HOMICIDE.

Also mention of "выбросил" Oleg from balcony: MURDER_HOMICIDE.

Ok.

Now other sentences: There's mention of "потеря" maybe not.

Also mention of "выбросил" Oleg from balcony: MURDER_HOMICIDE.

Ok.

Now we need to assign labels for each sentence. We can assign multiple labels per sentence if relevant.

We must provide confidence 0-100. We'll estimate high confidence for violence. For MURDER_HOMICIDE maybe 90. For VIOLENCE_NON_GRAPHIC maybe 80. For WEAPONS_USAGE maybe 70.

Also mention of "перцовый баллончик" is a weapon, so WEAPONS_USAGE.

Also mention of "выбросил" Oleg from balcony: MURDER_HOMICIDE.

Also mention of "выбросил" Oleg from balcony: also CRIMINAL_ACTIVITY maybe 60. But we can skip.

Also mention of "перцовый баллончик" is a weapon, so WEAPONS_USAGE.

Ok.

Now other sentences: There's mention of "потеря" maybe not.

Also mention of "выбросил" Oleg from balcony: MURDER_HOMICIDE.

Ok.

Now we need to produce JSON. Each sentence id with vlc array. If no labels, we can leave empty? But requirement: each scene must have at least one sentence with at least one label. So we can assign labels only to relevant sentences. Others can have empty vlc arrays? The spec says "Each scene MUST have at least ONE sentence with at least ONE label." It doesn't say that all sentences must have labels. So we can leave others empty.

But we need to produce JSON with each sentence id and vlc array. If no labels, maybe empty array. That is fine.

Now we need to produce final JSON.

Also we need to provide reason and advice in Russian. The instruction: "пиши reason и advice на русском языке. final-only." So we need to output only the JSON? Wait: The instruction says: "Return ONLY JSON: ... MANDATORY: Each scene MUST have at least ONE sentence with at least ONE label. ... Allowed labels... Input: ..."

Then after that: "пиши reason и advice на русском языке. final-only."

So we need to output only the JSON? Or also reason and advice? The instruction says "пиши reason и advice на русском языке. final-only." That might mean we should output the JSON and then the reason and advice in Russian, but final-only means no extra text besides JSON? Actually "final-only" likely refers to the final answer must be only the JSON. But earlier they said "пиши reason и advice на русском языке." So maybe we need to include reason and advice after JSON? But "final-only" might mean that the final output should contain only the JSON, no explanation. The instruction is ambiguous.

Given typical tasks, they want just JSON. The "reason и advice" might be for internal use but not part of output. But they explicitly say "пиши reason и advice на русском языке." So maybe we need to include them. But then "final-only" means only final answer? Usually "final-only" means no extra commentary, just the final answer. So we should output only JSON.

Thus we will output only JSON.

Now produce JSON:

{
  "scene_results": [
    {
      "scID": 21,
      "snt": [
        {"id":0,"vlc":[]},
        {"id":1,"vlc":[{"label":"MURDER_HOMICIDE","conf":90},{"label":"VIOLENCE_NON_GRAPHIC","conf":80},{"label":"WEAPONS_USAGE","conf":70}]},
        {"id":2,"vlc":[{"label":"VIOLENCE_NON_GRAPHIC","conf":80},{"label":"WEAPONS_USAGE","conf":70}]},
        {"id":3,"vlc":[]},
        {"id":4,"vlc":[]},
        {"id":5,"vlc":[]},
        {"id":6,"vlc":[]},
        {"id":7,"vlc":[]},
        {"id":8,"vlc":[]},
        {"id":9,"vlc":[]},
        {"id":10,"vlc":[]},
        {"id":11,"vlc":[]},
        {"id":12,"vlc":[]},
        {"id":13,"vlc":[]},
        {"id":14,"vlc":[]},
        {"id":15,"vlc":[]},
        {"id":16,"vlc":[]},
        {"id":17,"vlc":[]},
        {"id":18,"vlc":[]},
        {"id":19,"vlc":[]},
        {"id":20,"vlc":[]},
        {"id":21,"vlc":[]},
        {"id":22,"vlc":[]},
        {"id":23,"vlc":[]},
        {"id":24,"vlc":[]},
        {"id":25,"vlc":[]},
        {"id":26,"vlc":[]},
        {"id":27,"vlc":[]},
        {"id":28,"vlc":[]},
        {"id":29,"vlc":[]},
        {"id":30,"vlc":[]},
        {"id":31,"vlc":[]},
        {"id":32,"vlc":[]},
        {"id":33,"vlc":[]},
        {"id":34,"vlc":[]},
        {"id":35,"vlc":[]},
        {"id":36,"vlc":[]},
        {"id":37,"vlc":[]},
        {"id":38,"vlc":[]},
        {"id":39,"vlc":[]},
        {"id":40,"vlc":[]},
        {"id":41,"vlc":[]},
        {"id":42,"vlc":[]},
        {"id":43,"vlc":[]}
      ]
    }
  ]
}

But we need to ensure at least one sentence has label. We have id1 and id2 with labels.

Now we should check if any other sentences contain violence: "выбросил" Oleg from balcony is violent. Also mention of "перцовый баллончик" is a weapon. So we labeled those.

Also maybe mention of "выбросил" Oleg from balcony: also could be MURDER_HOMICIDE. Good.

Now we need to ensure no other sentences contain profanity or drugs etc. None.

Thus final JSON as above.

But we might want to include "MURDER_HOMICIDE" only for id1, not id2. But id2 is about pepper spray, so not homicide. So we can keep id2 with VIOLENCE_NON_GRAPHIC and WEAPONS_USAGE.

Now we need to ensure that each sentence has "vlc" array. For those without labels, we can leave empty array or maybe null? The spec says "vlc":[{"label":string,"conf":int}]. So we can provide empty array.

Thus final JSON.

Let's produce final answer.<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>{"scene_results":[{"scID":21,"snt":[{"id":0,"vlc":[]},{"id":1,"vlc":[{"label":"MURDER_HOMICIDE","conf":90},{"label":"VIOLENCE_NON_GRAPHIC","conf":80},{"label":"WEAPONS_USAGE","conf":70}]},{"id":2,"vlc":[{"label":"VIOLENCE_NON_GRAPHIC","conf":80},{"label":"WEAPONS_USAGE","conf":70}]},{"id":3,"vlc":[]},{"id":4,"vlc":[]},{"id":5,"vlc":[]},{"id":6,"vlc":[]},{"id":7,"vlc":[]},{"id":8,"vlc":[]},{"id":9,"vlc":[]},{"id":10,"vlc":[]},{"id":11,"vlc":[]},{"id":12,"vlc":[]},{"id":13,"vlc":[]},{"id":14,"vlc":[]},{"id":15,"vlc":[]},{"id":16,"vlc":[]},{"id":17,"vlc":[]},{"id":18,"vlc":[]},{"id":19,"vlc":[]},{"id":20,"vlc":[]},{"id":21,"vlc":[]},{"id":22,"vlc":[]},{"id":23,"vlc":[]},{"id":24,"vlc":[]},{"id":25,"vlc":[]},{"id":26,"vlc":[]},{"id":27,"vlc":[]},{"id":28,"vlc":[]},{"id":29,"vlc":[]},{"id":30,"vlc":[]},{"id":31,"vlc":[]},{"id":32,"vlc":[]},{"id":33,"vlc":[]},{"id":34,"vlc":[]},{"id":35,"vlc":[]},{"id":36,"vlc":[]},{"id":37,"vlc":[]},{"id":38,"vlc":[]},{"id":39,"vlc":[]},{"id":40,"vlc":[]},{"id":41,"vlc":[]},{"id":42,"vlc":[]},{"id":43,"vlc":[]}]}]}
