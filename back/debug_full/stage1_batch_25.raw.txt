<|channel|>analysis<|message|>We need to analyze Russian screenplay sentences. Return JSON with scene_results array. Each scene must have at least one sentence with at least one label. If all are neutral, assign MILD_CONFLICT to the most contextually active sentence.

We have scene 30 with 4 sentences. Let's examine each:

Sentence 0: "иносемёнов, прохожие Инофемёнов очень быстро бежит по тротуару." This seems like a typo but basically "Inosemenov, passersby Inofemenov run quickly on the sidewalk." No violence or conflict. Neutral.

Sentence 1: "Перепрыгивает через скамейки, детскую коляску." He jumps over benches and a stroller. No conflict.

Sentence 2: "Добегает до светофора, на котором стоит несколько машин." He runs to a traffic light where several cars are parked. Neutral.

Sentence 3: "Инофемёнов пробегает по капотам машин, убегает дальше." He runs over car hoods and runs away. No violence.

Thus all sentences are neutral. According to rule: If all are neutral, assign MILD_CONFLICT to the most contextually active sentence. Which is likely sentence 3 because it's the last one with action. So we need to label that sentence with MILD_CONFLICT.

We must output JSON:

{
"scene_results":[
 {"scID":30,"snt":[{"id":0,"vlc":[]},{"id":1,"vlc":[]},{"id":2,"vlc":[]},{"id":3,"vlc":[{"label":"MILD_CONFLICT","conf":?}]}]
}
]

We need confidence 0..100. Since it's a judgment, maybe 80.

Also we must provide reason and advice in Russian. The instruction: "пиши reason и advice на русском языке." So after JSON we should output reason and advice. But the final output must be only JSON? Wait: The instruction says: "Return ONLY JSON:" then shows format. Then "MANDATORY: Each scene MUST have at least ONE sentence with at least ONE label. If all are neutral, assign MILD_CONFLICT to the most contextually active sentence." Then after that: "Allowed labels..." Then "Input: ...". So we need to output only JSON. But then it says "пиши reason и advice на русском языке." That seems contradictory. The instruction earlier says return ONLY JSON. But then says write reason and advice in Russian. Maybe they want us to include reason and advice after JSON? But the instruction "Return ONLY JSON:" is explicit. So we should not include any other text. But then they ask for reason and advice. Possibly they want us to output both JSON and then separate lines with reason and advice. But that would violate "ONLY JSON". The instruction might be contradictory. Usually in these tasks, they want JSON plus explanation. But the first line says "Return ONLY JSON:" So we must comply. But also they ask for reason and advice. Maybe we can include them as part of JSON? Not allowed. So maybe we ignore that part. But the instruction is contradictory. In previous similar tasks, they want JSON only. So we will output JSON only.

Thus final answer: JSON with scene_results array.

Confidence 80.
