<|channel|>analysis<|message|>We need to analyze each sentence for labels. Provide JSON with scene_results array. Each scene has scID and snt array of objects with id and vlc array of label/conf pairs.

We must assign at least one label per scene. If all sentences are neutral, assign MILD_CONFLICT to most contextually active sentence. But here many violent or profanity. Let's identify.

Sentences:

0: "Артур нервно ходит взад-вперёд." Neutral.

1: "Выходит Алёна." Neutral.

2: "Надеюсь, у тебя что-то важное. артур Алён, я очень тебя люблю." Neutral.

3: "И доверие - это основа наших отношений, без него..." Neutral.

4: "Алёна нетерпеливо закатывает глаза." Neutral.

5: "Давай покороче." Neutral.

6: "...И, в общем, ... короче, прости." Neutral.

7: "Артур прыскает перцовым баллончиком Алёне в лицо." This is WEAPONS_USAGE? It's a weapon used. Also could be VIOLENCE_NON_GRAPHIC? It's a non-graphic violence. So label WEAPONS_USAGE and maybe VIOLENCE_NON_GRAPHIC. The guidelines: "WEAPONS_USAGE" for usage. Also "VIOLENCE_NON_GRAPHIC" for non-graphic violence. So we can assign both.

Confidence high 90.

8: "Алёна (громко) А-А-А!" Neutral reaction.

9: "Ты чё творишь, дебил?!" Contains profanity "дебил" is not obscene root? It's not in list. The list includes -бзд-;-бля-;-(ё/е)б-;-елд-;-говн-;-жоп-;-манд-;-муд-;-перд-;-пизд-;-сра-;-(с)са-;-хуе-/-хуй-/-хуя-;-шлюх-. "дебил" not included. So no PROFANITY_OBSCENE.

10: "Алёна кашляет, сгибается пополам, трёт глаза. артур Скажи что-то, что могла знать только Алёна! алёна Ты больной придурок, идиот, олень..." Contains profanity? "придурок" not obscene root. So none.

11: "- уязвлённая оценка." Neutral.

12: "Ну, зато теперь я верю, что в тебе нет личинки! алёна" Neutral.

13: "Дебила кусок!" Not obscene root.

14: "- оценка «капец»." Neutral.

15: "Алёна вся в слезах, громко кашляет." Neutral.

16: "Извини." Neutral.

17: "Очень больно? алёна А ты как думаешь?" Neutral.

18: "Ты где вообще, чтоб хоть врезать тебе..." Contains "врезать" maybe violent? It's a threat but not explicit. Could be MURDER_HOMICIDE? It's a threat to kill? "чтоб хоть врезать тебе" ambiguous. Might be violent threat. But guidelines: MURDER_HOMICIDE for clear attempt or commission. This is threat, not actual. So maybe no label.

19: "Алёна смотрит заплывшими, заплаканными, опухшими глазами примерно в направлении Артура. артур (собравшись) Не надо..." Neutral.

20: "Если это хоть немного сгладит мою вину..." Neutral.

21: "Артур, скривившись, прыскает себе в лицо баллончиком." WEAPONS_USAGE again.

22: "А-а-а!!! алёна" Neutral.

23: "Ты чё сделал?" Neutral.

24: "Артур плачет, трёт глаза. артур То же, что и тебе!" Neutral.

25: "Ааааа!!!" Neutral.

26: "Жжёт!!! аЛЁНА Ты реально дебил!" No obscene root.

27: "Артур падает на колени, кричит, рвёт траву, трёт ей глаза." Neutral.

Thus we have at least two sentences with WEAPONS_USAGE and VIOLENCE_NON_GRAPHIC. Also maybe MURDER_HOMICIDE? Not clear. So we can assign labels accordingly.

We need to produce JSON: {"scene_results":[{"scID":26,"snt":[{...}]}]}

For each sentence, include id and vlc array of label/conf pairs. For sentences with no labels, we might omit or provide empty array? The spec says each scene must have at least one sentence with at least one label. So we can include only those sentences that have labels. But the output format expects snt array for all sentences? It says "snt":[{"id":int,"vlc":[{"label":string,"conf":int}]}]. It doesn't say we must include all sentences. But likely we should include all sentences, but those with no labels can have empty vlc array. That is fine.

We need to assign confidence 0-100. For WEAPONS_USAGE and VIOLENCE_NON_GRAPHIC, high confidence 90. For others none.

Let's produce JSON accordingly.

Also provide reason and advice in Russian after JSON? The instruction: "пиши reason и advice на русском языке. final-only." Means we should output only the JSON? Wait: The instruction says: "Return ONLY JSON: ... MANDATORY: Each scene MUST have at least ONE sentence with at least ONE label. If all are neutral, assign MILD_CONFLICT to the most contextually active sentence. Gates: ... Allowed labels: ... Input: ..."

Then after that: "пиши reason и advice на русском языке. final-only." That seems contradictory: They want only JSON but also reason and advice? Maybe they want JSON plus reason/advice? The phrase "final-only" might mean the final answer should be only the JSON, no extra text. But then they say "пиши reason и advice на русском языке." So maybe they want both: first the JSON, then a separate section with reason and advice. But "final-only" indicates only final output. Hmm.

Let's interpret: They want the final answer to contain only the JSON. The earlier instruction "пиши reason и advice на русском языке" might be part of the system message? Actually it's part of user message: "пиши reason и advice на русском языке. final-only." So they want us to write reason and advice in Russian, but final-only means no other text besides that? Wait.

The earlier instruction: "Return ONLY JSON:" indicates we should only output JSON. Then "MANDATORY: Each scene MUST have at least ONE sentence with at least ONE label. If all are neutral, assign MILD_CONFLICT to the most contextually active sentence." So we must produce JSON accordingly.

Then "пиши reason и advice на русском языке. final-only." That might be a separate instruction: They want us to write reason and advice in Russian, but final-only means only that? This is confusing.

Maybe they want two parts: first the JSON, then after that a section with reason and advice. But "final-only" could mean we should not include any other text besides the final answer. So we need to output the JSON and then maybe a separate line with reason/advice? But that would violate "ONLY JSON".

Let's examine typical tasks: They often ask to output JSON only, but also want explanation. The phrase "пиши reason и advice на русском языке" might be a separate instruction for the assistant to provide reasoning and advice in Russian. But then "final-only" indicates we should not include any other text besides the final answer. So maybe they want us to output the JSON and then after that, a section with reason and advice? But that would be additional text.

Alternatively, maybe they want us to output only the JSON, but also provide reason and advice in Russian as part of the JSON? That seems unlikely.

Let's interpret: The user wants the assistant to produce JSON plus reason/advice. But "final-only" might refer to the final answer should not contain any other text besides the JSON and the reason/advice. So we can output:

{
  "scene_results": [...]
}
Reason: ...
Advice: ...

But that would be not only JSON. However, maybe they want the JSON first, then a separate section with reason and advice. But the instruction "Return ONLY JSON:" is strong.

Let's check typical patterns: In many tasks, they ask to output JSON only, but also ask for explanation. They sometimes say "You should output JSON only, but also provide reasoning." The final answer might include both. But the phrase "final-only" might mean no extra text besides the final answer. So we can produce JSON and then a separate section with reason/advice.

But to be safe, maybe we should output JSON only. Because the instruction says "Return ONLY JSON:" and then later "пиши reason и advice на русском языке. final-only." The "final-only" might refer to the final answer should not contain any other text besides the JSON. So we should not include reason/advice. But they explicitly ask for reason and advice. This is contradictory.

Let's decide: Provide JSON only, but also include a brief reason and advice in Russian after the JSON? That would violate "ONLY JSON". But maybe they want both. Let's examine the phrase: "пиши reason и advice на русском языке. final-only." It might mean: "Write reason and advice in Russian language. final-only." So they want us to write reason and advice, but only the final answer should be that? Actually "final-only" could refer to the final answer should not contain any other text besides the JSON. But then why ask for reason/advice? Maybe they want the assistant to produce the JSON and also provide reason/advice in Russian, but the final answer should only contain the JSON? That doesn't make sense.

Let's interpret that they want us to output JSON only, but also provide reason and advice in Russian as part of the JSON? We could embed them as fields. But not specified.

Given the confusion, I'll produce JSON only, because that's the explicit instruction "Return ONLY JSON". I will not include reason/advice. But maybe we can add a comment? No.

Thus final answer: JSON with scene_results.

Let's construct:

scene_results: array with one object: scID 26, snt array of 28 objects (id 0-27). For each, vlc array. For sentences with no labels, empty array.

For sentence 7: labels WEAPONS_USAGE and VIOLENCE_NON_GRAPHIC. Conf 90 each.

Sentence 21: same.

Also maybe sentence 18: threat to kill? Might be MURDER_HOMICIDE? But it's not clear. We can skip.

Thus produce JSON.

Let's craft:

{
  "scene_results": [
    {
      "scID": 26,
      "snt": [
        {"id":0,"vlc":[]},
        {"id":1,"vlc":[]},
        {"id":2,"vlc":[]},
        {"id":3,"vlc":[]},
        {"id":4,"vlc":[]},
        {"id":5,"vlc":[]},
        {"id":6,"vlc":[]},
        {"id":7,"vlc":[{"label":"WEAPONS_USAGE","conf":90},{"label":"VIOLENCE_NON_GRAPHIC","conf":90}]},
        {"id":8,"vlc":[]},
        {"id":9,"vlc":[]},
        {"id":10,"vlc":[]},
        {"id":11,"vlc":[]},
        {"id":12,"vlc":[]},
        {"id":13,"vlc":[]},
        {"id":14,"vlc":[]},
        {"id":15,"vlc":[]},
        {"id":16,"vlc":[]},
        {"id":17,"vlc":[]},
        {"id":18,"vlc":[]},
        {"id":19,"vlc":[]},
        {"id":20,"vlc":[]},
        {"id":21,"vlc":[{"label":"WEAPONS_USAGE","conf":90},{"label":"VIOLENCE_NON_GRAPHIC","conf":90}]},
        {"id":22,"vlc":[]},
        {"id":23,"vlc":[]},
        {"id":24,"vlc":[]},
        {"id":25,"vlc":[]},
        {"id":26,"vlc":[]},
        {"id":27,"vlc":[]}
      ]
    }
  ]
}

We must ensure JSON is valid. Provide final answer.<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>{"scene_results":[{"scID":26,"snt":[{"id":0,"vlc":[]},{"id":1,"vlc":[]},{"id":2,"vlc":[]},{"id":3,"vlc":[]},{"id":4,"vlc":[]},{"id":5,"vlc":[]},{"id":6,"vlc":[]},{"id":7,"vlc":[{"label":"WEAPONS_USAGE","conf":90},{"label":"VIOLENCE_NON_GRAPHIC","conf":90}]},{"id":8,"vlc":[]},{"id":9,"vlc":[]},{"id":10,"vlc":[]},{"id":11,"vlc":[]},{"id":12,"vlc":[]},{"id":13,"vlc":[]},{"id":14,"vlc":[]},{"id":15,"vlc":[]},{"id":16,"vlc":[]},{"id":17,"vlc":[]},{"id":18,"vlc":[]},{"id":19,"vlc":[]},{"id":20,"vlc":[]},{"id":21,"vlc":[{"label":"WEAPONS_USAGE","conf":90},{"label":"VIOLENCE_NON_GRAPHIC","conf":90}]},{"id":22,"vlc":[]},{"id":23,"vlc":[]},{"id":24,"vlc":[]},{"id":25,"vlc":[]},{"id":26,"vlc":[]},{"id":27,"vlc":[]}]}]}
