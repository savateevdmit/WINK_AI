<|channel|>analysis<|message|>We need to analyze each sentence for labels. Provide JSON with scene_results array. Each scene has scID and snt array of objects with id and vlc array of label/conf pairs.

We must assign at least one label per scene. If all sentences are neutral, assign MILD_CONFLICT to the most contextually active sentence. Here we have some conflict: "Эй, ты чего делаешь?!" etc. There's confrontation. No violence graphic, no murder, no drugs, no profanity obscene (none). So we can label MILD_CONFLICT for the most active sentence. Which is likely id 4 or 5 or 6 etc. Let's pick id 4: "Эй, ты чего делаешь?!" It's a conflict. Provide confidence maybe 80.

We need to include at least one label per scene. So we can assign MILD_CONFLICT to id 4. Others have no labels (empty array). But the requirement: Each sentence with at least one label? Actually "Each scene MUST have at least ONE sentence with at least ONE label." So only one sentence needs a label. Others can be empty. Provide vlc array for that sentence.

Thus output:

{
"scene_results":[
{"scID":15,"snt":[
{"id":0,"vlc":[]},
...
{"id":4,"vlc":[{"label":"MILD_CONFLICT","conf":80}]},
...
{"id":16,"vlc":[]}
]}
]

We must not include original texts. Provide reason and advice in Russian. But final output must be only JSON? The instruction: "Return ONLY JSON:" then after that "MANDATORY: Each scene MUST have at least ONE sentence with at least ONE label." Then "пиши reason и advice на русском языке. final-only." So we need to provide reason and advice in Russian, but final-only? It says "final-only." That might mean the final answer should be only JSON. But earlier it says "пиши reason и advice на русском языке." So maybe we need to output both: first the JSON, then reason and advice. But "final-only" indicates that the final answer should contain only the JSON. However the instruction is contradictory. Let's interpret: The system says "Return ONLY JSON:" then later "пиши reason и advice на русском языке. final-only." That might mean we should output the JSON only, but also provide reason and advice in Russian? But "final-only" maybe means the final answer should be only JSON, no extra text. So we should not include reason and advice. But earlier they said to write reason and advice. Hmm.

Let's read carefully: The instruction block:

"You analyze Russian screenplay sentences. Return ONLY JSON:
{...}
MANDATORY: Each scene MUST have at least ONE sentence with at least ONE label. If all are neutral, assign MILD_CONFLICT to the most contextually active sentence.
Gates:
...
Allowed labels: [...]
Input: [...]

"

Then after that: "пиши reason и advice на русском языке. final-only."

So they want us to write reason and advice in Russian, but final-only? Maybe they want the final answer to be only JSON, but also include reason and advice? The phrase "final-only" might refer to the final output should be only JSON, no other text. But then why ask for reason and advice? Possibly they want us to provide them separately, but final-only means the final answer is only JSON. So we need to produce two parts: first the JSON, then a separate section with reason and advice. But "final-only" might mean that the final output should be only JSON, no other text. The instruction is ambiguous.

Given typical tasks, they want the JSON output only. So I'll output only JSON. No reason or advice. But the instruction says to write reason and advice in Russian. That conflicts. I think we should include them after the JSON? But "final-only" might override that. I'd lean to produce only JSON. Because the system explicitly says "Return ONLY JSON:".

Thus final answer: JSON with scene_results.

Let's craft JSON:

{
  "scene_results": [
    {
      "scID": 15,
      "snt": [
        {"id":0,"vlc":[]},
        {"id":1,"vlc":[]},
        {"id":2,"vlc":[]},
        {"id":3,"vlc":[]},
        {"id":4,"vlc":[{"label":"MILD_CONFLICT","conf":80}]},
        {"id":5,"vlc":[]},
        {"id":6,"vlc":[]},
        {"id":7,"vlc":[]},
        {"id":8,"vlc":[]},
        {"id":9,"vlc":[]},
        {"id":10,"vlc":[]},
        {"id":11,"vlc":[]},
        {"id":12,"vlc":[]},
        {"id":13,"vlc":[]},
        {"id":14,"vlc":[]},
        {"id":15,"vlc":[]},
        {"id":16,"vlc":[]}
      ]
    }
  ]
}

Return that.<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>{"scene_results":[{"scID":15,"snt":[{"id":0,"vlc":[]},{"id":1,"vlc":[]},{"id":2,"vlc":[]},{"id":3,"vlc":[]},{"id":4,"vlc":[{"label":"MILD_CONFLICT","conf":80}]},{"id":5,"vlc":[]},{"id":6,"vlc":[]},{"id":7,"vlc":[]},{"id":8,"vlc":[]},{"id":9,"vlc":[]},{"id":10,"vlc":[]},{"id":11,"vlc":[]},{"id":12,"vlc":[]},{"id":13,"vlc":[]},{"id":14,"vlc":[]},{"id":15,"vlc":[]},{"id":16,"vlc":[]}]}]}
