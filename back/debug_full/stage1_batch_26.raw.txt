<|channel|>analysis<|message|>We need to analyze each sentence for labels. Provide JSON with scene_results array. Each scene must have at least one sentence with at least one label. If all are neutral, assign MILD_CONFLICT to most contextually active sentence.

We have 12 sentences (id 0-11). Let's examine content.

Sentence 0: "Участковый стоит перед открытой дверью, в проходе Мужик." No violence, drugs, profanity. Neutral.

1: "Рядом Соседка." Neutral.

2: "То есть, ещё рано утром машина была на месте?" Neutral.

3: "Да я ж говорю, я в магазин - ещё стояла." Neutral.

4: "Обратно иду - нету." Neutral.

5: "Главное, у нас же весь дом не абы кто, приличные люди." Neutral.

6: "Ни там алкашей, ни наркоманов..." Contains mention of alcohol and drugs but not consumption. It's a mention of presence of alcoholics and drug addicts. The label "DRUGS_MENTION_NON_DETAILED" maybe. Also "ALCOHOL_USE" is for use. This sentence says "Ни там алкашей, ни наркоманов..." meaning "No alcoholics or drug addicts there." It's a mention but not consumption. So we can assign DRUGS_MENTION_NON_DETAILED. Also maybe ALCOHOL_USE? But it's not usage. So only DRUGS_MENTION_NON_DETAILED.

7: "По лестнице, на четвереньках, на ощупь поднимаются Алёна и Артур, с красными слезящимися глазами." No violence. Maybe MILD_CONFLICT? Not necessarily. It's just describing them climbing. Could be mild conflict if they are in trouble? But no conflict.

8: "Пытаются выглядеть «нормально»." Neutral.

9: "Алёна/Артур Здравствуйте..." Neutral.

10: "Участковый, Мужик и Соседка переглядываются." Neutral.

11: "Алёна и Артур поднимаются выше." Neutral.

Thus only sentence 6 has a label. That satisfies requirement of at least one sentence with at least one label. So we can assign that.

We need to output JSON:

{
"scene_results":[
{"scID":31,"snt":[
{"id":0,"vlc":[]},
...
{"id":6,"vlc":[{"label":"DRUGS_MENTION_NON_DETAILED","conf":??}]},
...
]}

We need confidence 0-100. We can set 80 maybe.

Also we must not include original texts back. So only JSON.

Also we need to provide reason and advice in Russian? The instruction: "пиши reason и advice на русском языке." But final-only? Wait: The instruction says: "Do NOT include original texts back. пиши reason и advice на русском языке. final-only." That seems contradictory: They want reason and advice but final-only? Maybe they want the assistant to output only JSON, but also provide reason and advice in Russian? The phrase "final-only" might refer to the final answer should be only JSON. But earlier they said "пиши reason и advice на русском языке." So maybe they want both: Provide reason and advice in Russian, but final output must be JSON only. But that conflicts.

Let's interpret: They want the assistant to produce JSON only as final answer. The "reason" and "advice" might be internal? But they said "пиши reason и advice на русском языке." That suggests we should include them. However "final-only" indicates only JSON. Which is correct? Usually these tasks require only JSON output. So we will output only JSON.

Thus final answer: JSON with scene_results array.

We need to include all sentences with vlc arrays, even if empty. Provide at least one label for sentence 6.

Confidence maybe 90.

Let's produce:

{
"scene_results":[
{"scID":31,"snt":[
{"id":0,"vlc":[]},
{"id":1,"vlc":[]},
{"id":2,"vlc":[]},
{"id":3,"vlc":[]},
{"id":4,"vlc":[]},
{"id":5,"vlc":[]},
{"id":6,"vlc":[{"label":"DRUGS_MENTION_NON_DETAILED","conf":85}]},
{"id":7,"vlc":[]},
{"id":8,"vlc":[]},
{"id":9,"vlc":[]},
{"id":10,"vlc":[]},
{"id":11,"vlc":[]}
]}]}

Check formatting: JSON array of scene_results. Each scene has scID and snt array.

Return that.<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>{"scene_results":[{"scID":31,"snt":[{"id":0,"vlc":[]},{"id":1,"vlc":[]},{"id":2,"vlc":[]},{"id":3,"vlc":[]},{"id":4,"vlc":[]},{"id":5,"vlc":[]},{"id":6,"vlc":[{"label":"DRUGS_MENTION_NON_DETAILED","conf":85}]},{"id":7,"vlc":[]},{"id":8,"vlc":[]},{"id":9,"vlc":[]},{"id":10,"vlc":[]},{"id":11,"vlc":[]}]}]}}
