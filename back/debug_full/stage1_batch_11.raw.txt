<|channel|>analysis<|message|>We need to analyze Russian screenplay sentences. Input: scene 21 with two sentences: id0 "Хватит спать!" id1 "Приходи на чердак." We must assign labels. The sentences are neutral, no violence, no profanity. According to rule: Each scene MUST have at least ONE sentence with at least ONE label. If all are neutral, assign MILD_CONFLICT to the most contextually active sentence.

Thus we need to pick one sentence to label as MILD_CONFLICT. Which is more contextually active? "Приходи на чердак." maybe more action. So assign MILD_CONFLICT to id1. Provide JSON with scene_results array containing object with scID 21 and snt array with each sentence id and vlc array of labels. For id0, no labels? But must have at least one label per scene, not per sentence. So we can leave id0 with empty vlc or maybe no label. The format requires each sentence has "vlc" array. We can provide empty array. For id1, provide label MILD_CONFLICT with confidence maybe 80.

Return JSON only. Also need to write reason and advice in Russian? The instruction: "пиши reason и advice на русском языке." But final output must be only JSON. Wait: The instruction says: "You analyze Russian screenplay sentences. Return ONLY JSON: ... MANDATORY: Each scene MUST have at least ONE sentence with at least ONE label. If all are neutral, assign MILD_CONFLICT to the most contextually active sentence. Gates... Allowed labels... Input... Output." Then after that: "пиши reason и advice на русском языке. final-only." So we need to provide reason and advice in Russian, but final output must be only JSON? The instruction says "final-only" meaning final answer should be only JSON. But also says "пиши reason и advice на русском языке." That seems contradictory. Maybe they want us to include reason and advice in the response, but final output must be JSON only. Usually these tasks: Provide JSON plus explanation. But "final-only" indicates that the final answer should be only JSON. So we should not provide reason or advice. But the instruction says "пиши reason и advice на русском языке." Maybe they want us to include them after JSON? But "final-only" overrides. I think we should output only JSON. Let's do that.

Thus:

{
  "scene_results": [
    {
      "scID": 21,
      "snt": [
        {"id":0,"vlc":[]},
        {"id":1,"vlc":[{"label":"MILD_CONFLICT","conf":80}]}
      ]
    }
  ]
}

Return that.<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>{"scene_results":[{"scID":21,"snt":[{"id":0,"vlc":[]},{"id":1,"vlc":[{"label":"MILD_CONFLICT","conf":80}]}]}]}
