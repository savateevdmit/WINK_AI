<|channel|>analysis<|message|>We need to produce JSON with ans array. For each input, we have scID, id, pt, t, nt, vlc list. We must evaluate each label in vlc. For each label produce a det object with fields: label, sev, scr, rsn, adv, ok, suggest.

We need to use allowed labels exactly. The labels are from the "vlc" array. They are: VIOLENCE_NON_GRAPHIC, DANGEROUS_IMITABLE_ACTS, WEAPONS_USAGE. We must check each for severity and score.

We have base scores from fw.bs. For each label, we get base score. Then apply modifiers from fw.mod? The "mod" mapping includes many categories like "many", "gore", etc. But not relevant here. So just base score.

Then severity: use fw.th thresholds: None 0-24, Mild 25-49, Moderate 50-79, Severe 80-100.

Also we have block list for certain labels: e.g., WEAPONS_USAGE is not in block list. So no override.

We need to produce rsn (reason) and adv (advice) in Russian. Also ok boolean: true if acceptable? The policy says: "Drugs depiction only explicit illegal human use; else ok=false suggest DRUGS_MENTION_NON_DETAILED/REMOVE." Not relevant. For violence non-graphic, it's allowed but maybe mild severity. So ok=true.

For DANGEROUS_IMITABLE_ACTS: This is about dangerous acts that could be imitated. The policy says "DANGEROUS_IMITABLE_ACTS" likely moderate or severe? We need to check base score: fw.bs has no entry for DANGEROUS_IMITABLE_ACTS. Wait, in fw.bs list we have "DANGEROUS_IMITABLE_ACTS": 80. Yes. So base score 80 => Severe.

For WEAPONS_USAGE: base score 55 => Moderate.

Now severity mapping: 80-100 => Severe. 55-79 => Moderate. 40-49 => Mild. So we have:

VIOLENCE_NON_GRAPHIC: base 40 => Mild.

DANGEROUS_IMITABLE_ACTS: 80 => Severe.

WEAPONS_USAGE: 55 => Moderate.

Now we need to produce rsn: reason for severity. We can use the "crit" messages? For VIOLENCE_NON_GRAPHIC, crit says "Без крови/натурализма; кратко." But that's a criterion. We can produce a short reason: "Нарушение не содержит кровавых сцен, но описывает насилие." Something like that.

For DANGEROUS_IMITABLE_ACTS: we need to mention that depiction of dangerous act that could be imitated. So reason: "Показана опасная деятельность, которую зритель может попытаться воспроизвести."

For WEAPONS_USAGE: reason: "Показано использование оружия.".

Adv: advice in Russian. For mild: maybe "Можно оставить без изменений." For moderate: "Рассмотреть смягчение описания." For severe: "Необходимо удалить или изменить сцену." Also we can add suggestion: for severe, maybe "REMOVE" or "REWRITE". The "suggest" field: if ok=false, provide suggestion. But all are ok=true? For severe, maybe still ok but with caution? The policy says "Severe_overrides_mitigations" meaning severe content must be removed? Actually block list includes some labels as Severe. But DANGEROUS_IMITABLE_ACTS is not in block list. So we can keep but advise removal? The policy: "DANGEROUS_IMITABLE_ACTS" is a label, but no block. So we can keep but advise to remove or mitigate. So ok=true but adv says "Рассмотреть удаление или смягчение." Suggest maybe "REMOVE" or "REWRITE". But suggestion field is string|null. For severe maybe suggest "REMOVE". For moderate maybe "REWRITE". For mild maybe null.

Let's produce suggestions: For DANGEROUS_IMITABLE_ACTS (Severe) -> suggest "REMOVE". For WEAPONS_USAGE (Moderate) -> suggest "REWRITE" or "SMEAG". For VIOLENCE_NON_GRAPHIC (Mild) -> null.

Now we need to produce JSON with ans array. Each element: scID, id, det array of objects for each label.

We must include only the labels present in vlc. So for each query, create det array with 1 object per label.

Let's compute scr: base score. Provide brief rationale? The spec says "scr from bs (+/- brief rationale)". So scr is integer base score. We can add a comment? But scr field should be int. So just base score.

Now produce JSON:

{
"ans":[
{ "scID":4, "id":27, "det":[ {"label":"VIOLENCE_NON_GRAPHIC","sev":"Mild","scr":40,"rsn":"Описание насилия без крови и натурализма.","adv":"Можно оставить без изменений.","ok":true,"suggest":null} ]},
{ "scID":4, "id":37, "det":[ {"label":"DANGEROUS_IMITABLE_ACTS","sev":"Severe","scr":80,"rsn":"Показана опасная деятельность, которую зритель может попытаться воспроизвести.","adv":"Рассмотреть удаление сцены.","ok":true,"suggest":"REMOVE"} ]},
{ "scID":4, "id":55, "det":[ {"label":"WEAPONS_USAGE","sev":"Moderate","scr":55,"rsn":"Показано использование оружия.","adv":"Рассмотреть смягчение описания.","ok":true,"suggest":"REWRITE"} ]} ]
}

Check formatting: JSON keys must be strings. Provide final only.<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>{"ans":[{"scID":4,"id":27,"det":[{"label":"VIOLENCE_NON_GRAPHIC","sev":"Mild","scr":40,"rsn":"Описание насилия без крови и натурализма.","adv":"Можно оставить без изменений.","ok":true,"suggest":null}]},"scID":4,"id":37,"det":[{"label":"DANGEROUS_IMITABLE_ACTS","sev":"Severe","scr":80,"rsn":"Показана опасная деятельность, которую зритель может попытаться воспроизвести.","adv":"Рассмотреть удаление сцены.","ok":true,"suggest":"REMOVE"}]},"scID":4,"id":55,"det":[{"label":"WEAPONS_USAGE","sev":"Moderate","scr":55,"rsn":"Показано использование оружия.","adv":"Рассмотреть смягчение описания.","ok":true,"suggest":"REWRITE"}]}]
