<|channel|>analysis<|message|>We need to analyze Russian screenplay sentences. Return JSON with scene_results array. Each scene must have at least one sentence with at least one label. If all are neutral, assign MILD_CONFLICT to the most contextually active sentence.

We have input: scene 18, two sentences:

id0: "В доме погасли все окна." (All windows in the house went out? Means lights turned off? Actually "погасли" could mean lights turned off. It's neutral.)

id1: "Горит только окно на чердаке." (Only the attic window is on fire.) This indicates fire, but not violence graphic. Could be "MILD_CONFLICT" or maybe "WEAPONS_USAGE"? No. Fire is a hazard but not violence. There's no explicit violence. So we need to assign at least one label. The guidelines: If all are neutral, assign MILD_CONFLICT to the most contextually active sentence.

We have a fire, which is conflict. So we can label id1 with MILD_CONFLICT. Or maybe "CRIME_INSTRUCTIONS"? No. Fire could be "DANGEROUS_IMITABLE_ACTS"? Not exactly. The guidelines: "MILD_CONFLICT" is for mild conflict. So assign that to sentence 1.

We need to produce JSON:

{
  "scene_results": [
    {
      "scID": 18,
      "snt": [
        {"id": 0, "vlc": []},
        {"id": 1, "vlc": [{"label":"MILD_CONFLICT","conf":80}]}
      ]
    }
  ]
}

But we must ensure each scene has at least one sentence with at least one label. So id0 can have empty list or no labels? The spec says each scene must have at least ONE sentence with at least ONE label. So we can leave id0 with empty list, but id1 has label. That satisfies requirement.

But maybe we should also assign some label to id0? It's neutral. But we can keep empty.

Confidence: 80 or 90. Let's set 85.

Also we need to provide reason and advice in Russian. The instruction says "пиши reason и advice на русском языке." So after JSON, we need to output reason and advice. But the final output must be only JSON? Wait: The instruction says: "Return ONLY JSON:" then shows format. Then "MANDATORY: Each scene MUST have at least ONE sentence with at least ONE label. If all are neutral, assign MILD_CONFLICT to the most contextually active sentence." Then "Gates:" etc. Then "Allowed labels: [...]". Then "Input: ..."

But after that, the instruction says "пиши reason и advice на русском языке. final-only." That seems contradictory: "Return ONLY JSON" but also "пиши reason и advice". Maybe they want to output JSON plus reason and advice? The phrase "final-only" might mean only final answer. But earlier "Return ONLY JSON:" indicates we should not include other text. However the last line says "пиши reason и advice на русском языке. final-only." That suggests we need to provide reason and advice in Russian, but still final-only? This is ambiguous.

Let's interpret: They want us to output JSON only, but also provide reason and advice in Russian. But that conflicts with "Return ONLY JSON". Maybe they want the JSON plus a separate section for reason and advice. But the instruction "final-only" might mean we should not include any other text besides final answer. But earlier "Return ONLY JSON:" indicates no other text. So maybe we should only output JSON, but also include reason and advice inside JSON? That seems unlikely.

Let's examine typical pattern: In previous tasks, they ask to output JSON plus reason and advice. They might want the JSON as part of the answer, but also provide reason and advice after. But "Return ONLY JSON:" indicates no other text. However the last line says "пиши reason и advice на русском языке. final-only." That could mean we should write reason and advice in Russian, but still only final output? I'm confused.

Let's parse: The instruction block:

"You analyze Russian screenplay sentences. Return ONLY JSON:
{...}
MANDATORY: Each scene MUST have at least ONE sentence with at least ONE label. If all are neutral, assign MILD_CONFLICT to the most contextually active sentence.
Gates:
...
Allowed labels: [...]
Input: ..."

Then after that: "пиши reason и advice на русском языке. final-only."

So maybe they want us to output JSON plus a separate section with reason and advice in Russian. But "final-only" might mean we should not include any other text besides the final answer. But we already have JSON. So maybe we need to output JSON, then a line break, then "reason:" and "advice:" lines in Russian. That would be additional text beyond JSON, violating "Return ONLY JSON". But maybe they want that.

Let's check typical tasks: Usually they ask to output JSON only. But sometimes they add "пиши reason и advice" meaning we should also provide reasoning. But the instruction "Return ONLY JSON:" is explicit. So I think we must output only JSON. The "reason and advice" might be a separate instruction for internal use? But they say "пиши reason и advice на русском языке." That means "write reason and advice in Russian". So maybe they want us to include those as part of the answer, but not inside JSON? But that would violate "Return ONLY JSON".

Maybe the correct approach: Provide JSON, then after a blank line, provide reason and advice in Russian. But that would be two parts. The instruction "final-only" might mean we should not output any other text besides final answer. But we are giving final answer anyway.

Let's decide: We'll output JSON only, because that's what the first instruction says. Then we can add a comment? No.

But the last line says "пиши reason и advice на русском языке. final-only." That might be a separate instruction for the assistant to produce reason and advice in Russian, but not included in the final answer? But that would be contradictory.

Maybe they want us to output JSON plus a separate section with reason and advice. Let's do that: We'll output JSON, then a line "reason:" and "advice:" in Russian. That satisfies both.

But the instruction "Return ONLY JSON:" might be overridden by the later instruction. The last instruction is more specific: "пиши reason и advice на русском языке. final-only." So we should produce final answer with reason and advice in Russian, but no other text. But that would not be JSON. So maybe they want us to output JSON plus reason/advice.

Let's examine typical pattern: In many tasks, they ask to output JSON only. Then they add "пиши reason и advice" meaning we should also provide reasoning. But the instruction "Return ONLY JSON:" is usually strict. But sometimes they override with "final-only" meaning just final answer. I'm leaning that we need to output JSON only.

But the last line says "пиши reason и advice на русском языке." That might be a separate instruction for the assistant to produce reason and advice in Russian, but not part of the output? But that would be weird.

Let's interpret: The user wants us to analyze sentences and return JSON. Then they want us to also provide reason and advice in Russian. So we should output both. But "Return ONLY JSON:" might be a mistake. But we can comply with both by including reason and advice after JSON. That is likely what they expect.

Thus final answer: JSON block, then maybe a blank line, then "reason:" and "advice:" lines in Russian.

Let's produce:

{
  "scene_results": [
    {
      "scID": 18,
      "snt": [
        {"id": 0, "vlc": []},
        {"id": 1, "vlc": [{"label":"MILD_CONFLICT","conf":85}]}
      ]
    }
  ]
}

reason: ... advice: ...

We need to write reason and advice in Russian. Reason: Fire indicates conflict but not violence. So we label MILD_CONFLICT. Advice: If more context, consider labeling accordingly.

Let's produce final answer.<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>{
  "scene_results": [
    {
      "scID": 18,
      "snt": [
        {"id": 0, "vlc": []},
        {"id": 1, "vlc": [{"label":"MILD_CONFLICT","conf":85}]}
      ]
    }
  ]
}

**reason:** В предложении «Горит только окно на чердаке» описывается пожар, что подразумевает конфликтную ситуацию, но не содержит явных элементов насилия, убийства или других запрещённых действий. Поэтому применён ярлык MILD_CONFLICT с высокой уверенностью.

**advice:** При дальнейшем анализе учитывайте контекст: если в следующих сценах появятся более конкретные детали (например, причинение вреда людям, использование огня как оружия), можно добавить ярлыки WEAPONS_USAGE или VIOLENCE_NON_GRAPHIC. Если же пожар будет описан как случайная авария без насилия, оставьте только MILD_CONFLICT.
