<|channel|>analysis<|message|>We need to output JSON with key "non_neutral" and list of scene indices that likely contain any listed categories. We must be inclusive: if uncertain, include index. So we need to scan each scene for content that matches any category.

Categories list: VIOLENCE_GRAPHIC, VIOLENCE_NON_GRAPHIC, MURDER_HOMICIDE, SUICIDE_SELF_HARM, SEX_EXPLICIT, SEX_SUGGESTIVE, SEXUAL_VIOLENCE, NUDITY_EXPLICIT, NUDITY_NONSEXUAL, DRUGS_USE_DEPICTION, DRUGS_MENTION_NON_DETAILED, ALCOHOL_USE, TOBACCO_USE, CRIME_INSTRUCTIONS, CRIMINAL_ACTIVITY, WEAPONS_USAGE, WEAPONS_MENTION, PROFANITY_OBSCENE, ABUSE_HATE_EXTREMISM, HORROR_FEAR, DANGEROUS_IMITABLE_ACTS, MEDICAL_GORE_DETAILS, GAMBLING, MILD_CONFLICT, EXTREMISM_PROPAGANDA, NAZISM_PROPAGANDA, FASCISM_PROPAGANDA.

We need to identify scenes that likely contain any of these categories. Let's analyze each scene.

Scene 0: It's about a police award ceremony. No violence, no crime instructions. There's mention of "преступлений" but not instructions. No explicit content. So likely neutral. No category.

Scene 1: "Варвара резко просыпается." Nothing else. Neutral.

Scene 2: Circus scene with juggling knives, etc. Sentences: "Жонглер жонглирует булавами." That is weapons usage? Juggling knives (булавы). That's weapons mention and usage? It's a performance; but still mention of weapons. Category WEAPONS_USAGE or WEAPONS_MENTION. Also "стрельба" maybe. There's also mention of "сахарную вату" etc. No violence. So scene 2 likely includes WEAPONS_USAGE. Also maybe MILD_CONFLICT? Not really. So include index 2.

Scene 3: Family conversation about wedding, no violence. No categories.

Scene 4: Circus performance with a magician using a saw to cut a box, but it's a magic trick. There's mention of "пилу", "распиливает коробку". That is weapons usage? It's a prop. But still mention of a saw. Also "фокусник помещает ассистентку в коробку" and "распиливает". Not actual violence. But maybe WEAPONS_USAGE. Also mention of "пилу" could be considered. Also "факел" with kerosene, but no violence. So include index 4.

Scene 5: Scene 5 is about a boy with a locket, a crow appears. No violence. No categories.

Scene 6: Similar to scene 5. No violence.

Thus indices likely containing categories: 2 and 4. Also maybe 0? There's mention of "особо опасных и таинственных преступлений" but no instructions. So not crime instructions. So exclude.

Also check for alcohol use: None. Tobacco: none. Drugs: none. Profanity: none. Sexual content: none. Nudity: none. Violence: none. So only weapons usage.

Thus output: {"non_neutral":[2,4]}.<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>{"non_neutral":[2,4]}
