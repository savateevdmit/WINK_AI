<|channel|>analysis<|message|>We need to analyze each sentence for labels. Provide JSON with scene_results array. Each scene must have at least one sentence with at least one label. If all are neutral, assign MILD_CONFLICT to most contextually active sentence.

We have scene 27 with 12 sentences (id 0-11). Let's examine each:

id0: "Понурив голову, Варвара возвращается в поселок." Means "Bowing her head, Varvara returns to the village." No violence, no drugs, etc. Neutral.

id1: "7-28." Just a number. Neutral.

id2: "НАТ./ИНТ." Probably abbreviation for "натуральный/интерьер"? Not relevant. Neutral.

id3: "ЦИРК." Means "Circus." Neutral.

id4: "ФУРГОН С ДИКИМИ ЖИВОТНЫМИ - ДЕНЬ Факирша заходит в трейлер, где содержатся дикие животные." Means "Van with wild animals - day. Fakirsha enters the trailer where wild animals are kept." Neutral.

id5: "Она идёт вдоль клеток." She walks along cages. Neutral.

id6: "Из одной на нее рычит лев." A lion roars at her. This is a threat but not violence? It's a threat of violence. Could be considered "WEAPONS_USAGE" or "VIOLENCE_NON_GRAPHIC"? The lion is an animal weapon. But the label list includes WEAPONS_USAGE, WEAPONS_MENTION. That might apply. Also could be "MURDER_HOMICIDE" if it's about killing? Not yet. So we can label as WEAPONS_USAGE maybe. But the lion roars at her; it's a threat but not actual violence. The label "WEAPONS_USAGE" is for usage of weapons. A lion is a weapon? Might be considered "WEAPONS_MENTION". But the lion is an animal, not a weapon. However, the list includes "WEAPONS_USAGE" and "WEAPONS_MENTION". We can choose WEAPONS_MENTION because it's mention of a weapon (lion). But maybe better to use "VIOLENCE_NON_GRAPHIC" because there's threat of violence. The lion roars at her; it's a violent threat but not graphic. So label: VIOLENCE_NON_GRAPHIC.

id7: "Факирша доходит до самой последней." She reaches the last one. Neutral.

id8: "В этой клетке вместо зверей неподвижно сидят Дрессировщик и его дочь Юля." In this cage instead of animals, trainer and daughter sit. Neutral.

id9: "Их глаза открыты." Their eyes open. Neutral.

id10: "Но они будто спят." But they seem to sleep. Neutral.

id11: "Рядом клетка с вороном." Next to a cage with a raven. Neutral.

Thus only id6 has a label. So we can assign VIOLENCE_NON_GRAPHIC with confidence maybe 80. Others no labels.

We must ensure each scene has at least one sentence with at least one label. We have that.

Return JSON: {"scene_results":[{"scID":27,"snt":[{"id":6,"vlc":[{"label":"VIOLENCE_NON_GRAPHIC","conf":80}]}]}]}

But we need to include all sentences? The format says each scene has snt array of objects with id and vlc. We can include only those with labels? The spec: "Return ONLY JSON: {"scene_results":[{"scID":int,"snt":[{"id":int,"vlc":[{"label":string,"conf":int}]}]}]}" It doesn't say we must include all sentences, but likely we should include only those with labels. But to be safe, we can include all sentences with empty vlc? The spec says each scene MUST have at least ONE sentence with at least ONE label. So we need to include at least one. We can include only the labeled ones. That is fine.

Thus final JSON as above.

Also we need to provide reason and advice in Russian. The instruction: "пиши reason и advice на русском языке. final-only." Means we should output only the final answer? Wait: The instruction says: "пиши reason и advice на русском языке. final-only." That might mean we should output only the final JSON, not the reason and advice. But earlier it said "Return ONLY JSON". So we must not include reason or advice. The phrase "пиши reason и advice на русском языке" maybe refers to internal reasoning? But the instruction says "final-only." So we should output only the JSON. So no reason or advice.

Thus final answer: JSON.<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>{"scene_results":[{"scID":27,"snt":[{"id":6,"vlc":[{"label":"VIOLENCE_NON_GRAPHIC","conf":80}]}]}]}
