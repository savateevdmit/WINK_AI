<|channel|>analysis<|message|>We need to analyze each sentence for labels. Provide JSON with scene_results array. Each scene must have at least one sentence with at least one label. If all are neutral, assign MILD_CONFLICT to most contextually active sentence.

We have 12 sentences (id 0-11). Let's examine content.

Sentence 0: "Площадка за цирком огорожена сеткой." Neutral.

1: "На ней знак \"Осторожно!\"" Neutral.

2: "Хищники!\" Варя и Вася пролезают под сеткой." Contains "пролезают" under fence. No violence, just action. Could be MILD_CONFLICT? It's a risky activity but not conflict. Might be considered MILD_CONFLICT because they are doing something illegal or dangerous. But guidelines: MILD_CONFLICT label for neutral sentences if all are neutral. But we have some sentences with potential conflict? Let's see.

3: "Вася помогает Варе пролезть, придерживая сетку." Neutral.

4: "А если нас поймают?" This is a question about being caught. Could be MILD_CONFLICT.

5: "Расследование всегда сопряжено с риском." Also risk. MILD_CONFLICT.

6: "За сеткой припаркованы трейлеры, в которых живут цирковые артисты." Neutral.

7: "Варвара и Вася видят, как девочка с вороном заходит в один из трейлеров." Neutral.

8: "Она выходит уже без ворона." Neutral.

9: "Девочка закрывает дверь на ключ и уходит." Neutral.

10: "Когда она скрывается из вида, Варя с Васей подходят к трейлеру." Neutral.

11: "Варя замечает, что открыто окно-люк на крыше трейлера." Neutral.

So no explicit violence, drugs, profanity. So all neutral. According to rule: Each scene must have at least one sentence with at least one label. If all are neutral, assign MILD_CONFLICT to the most contextually active sentence. Which is likely sentence 2 or 4/5. Sentence 2 is action of breaking fence. That seems most active. So we assign MILD_CONFLICT to sentence id 2.

We need to output JSON: {"scene_results":[{"scID":7,"snt":[{"id":2,"vlc":[{"label":"MILD_CONFLICT","conf":?}]}]}]}

Confidence: maybe 90. Provide reason and advice in Russian. But the instruction says "Do NOT include original texts back." So we should not output the sentence text. Just JSON. Then after that, "пиши reason и advice на русском языке." So we need to provide reason and advice in Russian after JSON? The instruction: "пиши reason и advice на русском языке. final-only." Means final output must be only JSON? Wait: The instruction says: "You analyze Russian screenplay sentences. Return ONLY JSON: ... MANDATORY: Each scene MUST have at least ONE sentence with at least ONE label. If all are neutral, assign MILD_CONFLICT to the most contextually active sentence. Gates: ... Allowed labels: ... Input: ..."

Then after that: "пиши reason и advice на русском языке. final-only." This seems contradictory: "Return ONLY JSON" but also "пиши reason и advice". Maybe they want JSON plus separate lines of reason and advice? But "final-only" indicates only final answer should be output, no extra commentary. The instruction "пиши reason и advice на русском языке" might mean we should include a field in JSON for reason and advice? But not specified. Usually these tasks: produce JSON and then after that provide reason and advice. But "final-only" means only final answer. So maybe they want just JSON. But the earlier instruction says "Return ONLY JSON". So we must output only JSON. The "пиши reason и advice" might be a separate instruction for internal reasoning? But it's ambiguous.

Given typical pattern: They ask to produce JSON and then also provide reason and advice in Russian. But "final-only" indicates no extra text besides final answer. So maybe they want JSON plus reason/advice lines after? But that would violate "Return ONLY JSON". I'd lean to output only JSON. But the instruction "пиши reason и advice на русском языке" might be part of the answer: we need to include reason and advice in Russian. But then "final-only" means no other text besides final answer. So maybe we should output JSON plus two lines: "reason:" and "advice:"? But that would not be JSON.

Let's interpret: They want us to produce JSON, but also provide reason and advice in Russian. But the instruction "Return ONLY JSON" conflicts. Maybe they mean: The output must be only JSON, but we can include fields for reason and advice inside JSON. But not specified. Usually these tasks: Provide JSON with labels, then after that separate lines of reason and advice. But "final-only" indicates no extra commentary beyond final answer. So I'd produce JSON only.

Thus final answer: JSON with scene_results array containing scID 7, snt array with one object id 2, vlc array with label MILD_CONFLICT and confidence maybe 90.

Let's set confidence 90.

Return:

{"scene_results":[{"scID":7,"snt":[{"id":2,"vlc":[{"label":"MILD_CONFLICT","conf":90}]}]}]}
