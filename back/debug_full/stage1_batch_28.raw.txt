<|channel|>analysis<|message|>We need to analyze each sentence for labels. Provide JSON with scene_results array. Each scene has scID and snt array of objects with id and vlc array of label/conf pairs.

We must assign at least one label per scene. If all sentences are neutral, assign MILD_CONFLICT to most contextually active sentence. But here we have violent content: "крушит мебель" (breaks furniture), "Входит Олег с битой" (bottle? Actually "битой" could be a bat or bottle? Likely a bat). There's potential violence. Also "Инфемёнов бешеным взглядом смотрит на Олега." Not violent but conflict.

We need to assign labels: VIOLENCE_NON_GRAPHIC maybe for breaking furniture, and WEAPONS_USAGE for Oleg with bat. Also MURDER_HOMICIDE? No attempt to kill. So not homicide. So we can label sentence 1 with VIOLENCE_NON_GRAPHIC. Sentence 2 with WEAPONS_USAGE. Maybe also MILD_CONFLICT for overall scene.

We must include at least one label per scene. We can assign multiple labels per sentence. Provide confidence values. Let's set high confidence 90 for violence, 85 for weapons usage. For MILD_CONFLICT maybe 70.

But we need to decide which sentence is most contextually active: likely sentence 1 or 2. Sentence 1: "Инфемёнов злится, крушит мебель." That's violent. So assign MILD_CONFLICT to that sentence too? But we already have VIOLENCE_NON_GRAPHIC. We can include both labels.

We need to produce JSON only. Also provide reason and advice in Russian. The instruction says: "Do NOT include original texts back. пиши reason и advice на русском языке. final-only." So after JSON, we must write reason and advice in Russian. But the output format: "Return ONLY JSON:" then the JSON. Then "MANDATORY: Each scene MUST have at least ONE sentence with at least ONE label. If all are neutral, assign MILD_CONFLICT to the most contextually active sentence." Then "Allowed labels..." So we need to produce JSON only? The instruction says "Return ONLY JSON:" but then also says "пиши reason и advice на русском языке. final-only." That seems contradictory: we must output JSON and then reason/advice? But "final-only" maybe means final answer only. The instruction: "Return ONLY JSON:" then after that, "MANDATORY..." etc. Then "Allowed labels". Then "Do NOT include original texts back. пиши reason и advice на русском языке. final-only." So we need to output JSON and then reason/advice? But "final-only" maybe means only final answer. The instruction is ambiguous.

Given typical tasks, they want JSON plus reason/advice. But the first line says "Return ONLY JSON:" So likely we should output only JSON. But then they say "пиши reason и advice на русском языке." That suggests we need to include reason and advice. Maybe they want JSON plus a separate section with reason and advice. But "final-only" maybe means final answer only, no extra commentary.

Let's interpret: Provide JSON, then after that, provide reason and advice in Russian. The instruction "Return ONLY JSON:" might be part of the system prompt but not enforced? Hard to know.

Given typical tasks from this dataset, they want JSON output only. But they also ask for reason and advice. Maybe they want both. Let's produce JSON first, then a separate section with reason and advice. But ensure no original texts included.

I'll produce:

{
  "scene_results":[
    {
      "scID":33,
      "snt":[
        {"id":0,"vlc":[{"label":"VIOLENCE_NON_GRAPHIC","conf":90},{"label":"MILD_CONFLICT","conf":70}]},
        {"id":1,"vlc":[{"label":"WEAPONS_USAGE","conf":85}]},
        {"id":2,"vlc":[]},
        {"id":3,"vlc":[]},
        {"id":4,"vlc":[]}
      ]
    }
  ]
}

But we need at least one label per scene. We have labels for sentences 0 and 1. That's fine.

We might also add MURDER_HOMICIDE? No.

We should not include empty vlc arrays? It's okay but maybe better to omit sentences with no labels? But the structure expects each sentence object. We can leave empty array.

Now reason and advice: In Russian: "В сцене присутствует насилие и оружие, поэтому применены соответствующие метки." Provide advice: "При дальнейшей работе учитывайте контекст и избегайте излишней детализации."

Let's produce final answer with JSON then reason/advice.<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>{"scene_results":[{"scID":33,"snt":[{"id":0,"vlc":[{"label":"VIOLENCE_NON_GRAPHIC","conf":90},{"label":"MILD_CONFLICT","conf":70}]},{"id":1,"vlc":[{"label":"WEAPONS_USAGE","conf":85}]},{"id":2,"vlc":[]},{"id":3,"vlc":[]},{"id":4,"vlc":[]}]}]}

**Причина:** В сцене явно выражено насилие (разрушение мебели) и присутствие оружия (бита), поэтому применены метки VIOLENCE_NON_GRAPHIC и WEAPONS_USAGE. Для усиления контекста конфликту присвоена метка MILD_CONFLICT.

**Совет:** При дальнейшей работе с подобными сценами учитывайте, что наличие оружия и разрушений может усиливать эмоциональное напряжение; при необходимости уточняйте степень угрозы и возможные последствия действий персонажей.
