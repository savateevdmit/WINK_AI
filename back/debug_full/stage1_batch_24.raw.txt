<|channel|>analysis<|message|>We need to analyze each sentence for labels. Provide JSON with scene_results array. Each scene has scID and snt array of objects with id and vlc array of label/conf pairs.

We must assign at least one label per scene. If all sentences are neutral, assign MILD_CONFLICT to most contextually active sentence. We need to evaluate each sentence for presence of any of the allowed labels.

Let's examine sentences:

0: "ам, иносемёнов, массовка: посетители, персонал Семёнов обречённо подходит к АМ. семёнов (ам) Анна Михайловна извините меня, пожалуйста, вот, я вам обещал..." This seems neutral, no violence, drugs, profanity.

1: "Семёнов отдаёт АМ флешку. ам Спасибо..." Neutral.

2: "Евгений Андреевич, может вам...?" Neutral.

3: "У меня есть телефон хорошего гастроэнтеролога..." Neutral.

4: "АМ достаёт телефон." Neutral.

5: "Семёнов моргает, меняется в лице. «Возвращается» Инофемёнов, непонимающе оглядывается по сторонам. иносемёнов Что здесь только что произошло?" Neutral.

6: "АМ удивлённо смотрит на Инофемёнова. ам Смотря с какого момента..." Neutral.

7: "Инофемёнов смотрит на телефон в своей руке." Neutral.

8: "ГРАФИКА: экран телефона Семёнова - последний вызов «Алёна»." Neutral.

9: "Иносемёнов (испуганно) Корабль!" Possibly indicates fear? But no violence. Could be mild conflict? Not sure.

10: "Инофемёнов очень быстро выбегает из ресторана." Neutral.

11: "АМ - непонимающая оценка." Neutral.

12: "Допивает бокал вина." Alcohol use. Label: ALCOHOL_USE. Confidence maybe 80.

13: "Удовлетворённо смотрит на флешку." Neutral.

Thus only sentence 12 has a label. So we can assign ALCOHOL_USE to sentence 12 with confidence 80. All other sentences have no labels, but we need at least one label per scene. We already have one. Good.

But we must ensure each sentence's vlc array includes at least one label if any. For sentences without labels, we can leave empty array? The schema: "snt":[{"id":int,"vlc":[{"label":string,"conf":int}]}]. It doesn't say that vlc must be non-empty. But maybe we should include empty arrays for neutral sentences. That is fine.

We need to produce JSON with scene_results array containing one object for scID 29.

Also we need to provide "reason" and "advice" in Russian. The instruction: "пиши reason и advice на русском языке. final-only." So after JSON, we need to output reason and advice? Wait: The instruction says: "You analyze Russian screenplay sentences. Return ONLY JSON: ... MANDATORY: Each scene MUST have at least ONE sentence with at least ONE label. If all are neutral, assign MILD_CONFLICT to the most contextually active sentence. Gates: ... Allowed labels: ... Input: ..."

Then after that: "пиши reason и advice на русском языке. final-only." So we need to output only JSON? But then says write reason and advice in Russian. That seems contradictory. The instruction: "Return ONLY JSON:" then later "пиши reason и advice на русском языке. final-only." Maybe they want the JSON plus a separate section with reason and advice? But "final-only" indicates that the final answer should only contain the JSON? Wait: The phrase "final-only" might refer to the final output must be only the JSON, no other text. But then they say "пиши reason и advice на русском языке." That seems like they want a separate explanation. However earlier they said "Return ONLY JSON". So we must obey that. But maybe they want the JSON plus a separate section with reason and advice? The instruction is ambiguous.

Let's parse: The system message says: "You analyze Russian screenplay sentences. Return ONLY JSON: ... MANDATORY: Each scene MUST have at least ONE sentence with at least ONE label. If all are neutral, assign MILD_CONFLICT to the most contextually active sentence. Gates: ... Allowed labels: ... Input: ..."

Then after that: "пиши reason и advice на русском языке. final-only."

It might mean: Provide the JSON and then also provide a separate section with reason and advice in Russian. But "final-only" maybe means the final answer should only contain the JSON? Actually "final-only" could refer to the final output must be only the JSON, no other text. But then they ask for reason and advice. So contradictory.

Maybe the instruction is: Provide the JSON, but also provide a separate section with reason and advice in Russian. But "final-only" might mean that the final answer should not contain any additional explanation beyond the JSON? Hmm.

Let's look at typical tasks: They often say "Return ONLY JSON" and then "пиши reason и advice на русском языке." That could mean we need to output JSON plus a separate section with reason and advice. But "final-only" might refer to the final answer should only contain the JSON, no other text. But they also ask for reason and advice. So maybe they want the JSON and then after that, in separate lines, the reason and advice. But that would violate "Return ONLY JSON".

Maybe the instruction is: Provide the JSON, but also provide a separate section with reason and advice. The phrase "final-only" might refer to the final answer should only contain the JSON? I'm leaning that they want just JSON. But then why ask for reason and advice? Possibly they want the assistant to produce the JSON and then separately produce reason and advice in Russian, but not as part of the JSON. But the instruction "Return ONLY JSON:" is explicit.

Let's examine previous tasks: Usually they say "Return ONLY JSON" and then "пиши reason и advice на русском языке." That might mean we need to output JSON plus a separate section with reason and advice. But that would violate "ONLY JSON". However maybe they want the JSON as the main content, but also provide reason and advice after it. The phrase "final-only" might refer to the final answer should only contain the JSON? I'm not sure.

Let's interpret: They want the assistant to output the JSON, then a separate section with reason and advice in Russian. But the instruction "Return ONLY JSON:" is contradictory. However maybe they want the JSON as the main content, but also provide reason and advice. The phrase "final-only" might mean that the final answer should not contain any other text besides the JSON? But then they'd ask for reason and advice. So maybe they want the JSON plus reason/advice but no other extraneous text.

Let's decide: Provide JSON, then a separate section with reason and advice in Russian. That seems plausible.

But we need to format properly. The JSON must be valid. Then after that, we can add lines like "reason: ..." and "advice: ...". But that would break the JSON if not separated. We could output JSON first, then newline, then "reason: ..." etc. That might be acceptable.

Alternatively, we could embed reason and advice inside the JSON as separate keys? But they didn't specify that. They said "Return ONLY JSON:" so maybe we should only output JSON. Then "пиши reason и advice на русском языке." That might mean we need to write them in Russian but not include them in JSON? I'm confused.

Let's examine typical pattern: In some tasks, they ask for JSON and also ask for explanation. They often say "Return ONLY JSON" and then "Write the reasoning in a separate section". But here they didn't specify separate section. They just said "пиши reason и advice на русском языке." So maybe they want the assistant to output the JSON and then after that, in plain text, provide reason and advice. That would be not only JSON.

But the instruction "Return ONLY JSON:" is quite explicit. I think we should obey that: only JSON. But then how to provide reason and advice? Maybe we can embed them as fields in the JSON? For example, add keys "reason" and "advice" at top-level. That would still be JSON. That might satisfy both.

But the schema didn't mention those keys. But we could add them; it's still JSON. The instruction didn't forbid adding extra keys. But they said "Return ONLY JSON:" with a specific structure. So maybe we should not add extra keys.

Thus I think the best is to output only JSON, no reason/advice. But then we would violate the second instruction. Hmm.

Let's read again: "пиши reason и advice на русском языке. final-only." Maybe they want the assistant to write the reason and advice in Russian, but the final answer should be only the JSON. So maybe the assistant should produce the JSON as final answer, but also produce a separate explanation earlier? But we can't produce two outputs. The instruction "final-only" might mean that the final output must be only the JSON, no other text. So we should not include reason/advice. But then why ask for them? Maybe they want the assistant to internally think about reason and advice but not output them. But the instruction says "пиши reason и advice на русском языке." That is a direct instruction to write them.

This is contradictory. We need to choose one. Usually the system message is higher priority than user message. The system message says: "You analyze Russian screenplay sentences. Return ONLY JSON: ...". So we must obey that. The user message says "пиши reason и advice на русском языке. final-only." But system message overrides. So we should output only JSON.

Thus we will output the JSON only. No reason/advice. That satisfies system instruction.

Let's produce JSON:

{
  "scene_results": [
    {
      "scID": 29,
      "snt": [
        {"id":0,"vlc":[]},
        {"id":1,"vlc":[]},
        {"id":2,"vlc":[]},
        {"id":3,"vlc":[]},
        {"id":4,"vlc":[]},
        {"id":5,"vlc":[]},
        {"id":6,"vlc":[]},
        {"id":7,"vlc":[]},
        {"id":8,"vlc":[]},
        {"id":9,"vlc":[]},
        {"id":10,"vlc":[]},
        {"id":11,"vlc":[]},
        {"id":12,"vlc":[{"label":"ALCOHOL_USE","conf":80}]},
        {"id":13,"vlc":[]}
      ]
    }
  ]
}

We need to ensure that each sentence has at least one label? No, only the scene must have at least one sentence with at least one label. That's satisfied.
