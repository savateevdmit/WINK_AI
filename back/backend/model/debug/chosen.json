{
  "final_rating": "6+",
  "explanation": "The content contains multiple violations that exceed the 0+ and 6+ thresholds. 1) **TOBACCO_USE** (scene 0‑sentence 6, scene 5‑sentence 1) is prohibited in 0+ and 6+ but allowed in 12+. 2) **MURDER_HOMICIDE** and **VIOLENCE_GRAPHIC** (scene 1‑sentence 4, scene 1‑sentence 10, scene 1‑sentence 21) are disallowed in 0+, 6+, and 12+; they are only permissible in 16+ with strict non‑graphic depiction and condemnation. 3) **SEXUAL_VIOLENCE** (scene 1‑sentence 7) is prohibited in all categories below 18+. 4) **PROFANITY_OBSCENE** (scene 1‑sentence 17) is disallowed in 0+, 6+, 12+, and 16+; it is only allowed in 18+. 5) **WEAPONS_USAGE** (scene 1‑sentence 13, scene 1‑sentence 37) is prohibited in 0+, 6+, 12+, and 16+ unless accompanied by condemnation; the text lacks such condemnation. 6) **VIOLENCE_NON_GRAPHIC** (scene 1‑sentence 1, scene 3‑sentence 9) is disallowed in 0+, 6+, 12+ but allowed in 16+. 7) **MILD_CONFLICT** (scene 0‑sentence 9) is prohibited in 0+ and 6+; it is only permissible in 12+. 8) **TOBACCO_USE** in scene 5‑sentence 1 occurs in a family context, but the presence of other disallowed content overrides any mitigating factor. 9) No category contains hard 18+ criteria (e.g., explicit sexual content, drug use depiction, extremist propaganda). Therefore the lowest permissible rating that allows all content is **6+**."
