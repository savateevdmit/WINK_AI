<|channel|>analysis<|message|>We need to assign lowest acceptable age rating for the content. We have many sentences with various labels. We must consider overall content. The content includes gambling, crime, mild conflict, violence non-graphic, violence graphic (blood on newspaper). There's a single violent graphic sentence: "Схватив билетики с тележки, вы испачкали газету кровью." That's a graphic depiction of blood. Also mention of dog bite. There's also mention of theft, crime. No sexual content. No drug use. No profanity. So we need to determine rating.

We must consider the most severe category present. The highest severity among categories: Violence_Gore includes VIOLENCE_GRAPHIC (Severe). That triggers rating at least 12+? Let's see thresholds:

- For 6+: Violences allowed but no graphic? 6+ prohibits graphic violence. So 6+ not allowed.

- For 12+: Graphic violence is prohibited? Let's check 12+ description: "Запрещено натуралистичное изображение процесса убийства или нанесения увечий." It says graphic depiction of violence is prohibited. So 12+ cannot have graphic violence. So we need at least 16+.

- For 16+: Graphic violence allowed? Let's check 16+ description: "Запрещено натуралистичное (графичное) изображение насилия, болезней, увечий, смерти с демонстрацией кровавых или шокирующих деталей." So 16+ also prohibits graphic depiction. Wait 16+ says "Запрещено натуралистичное (графичное) изображение насилия, болезней, увечий, смерти с демонстрацией кровавых или шокирующих деталей." That means graphic violence is prohibited at 16+. So maybe 18+? Let's check 18+ description: "Контент запрещен для распространения среди детей до 18 лет. Содержит информацию, причиняющую вред здоровью и развитию детей всех возрастных категорий, включая запрещенную информацию по статье 5 части 2 закона." That includes all prohibited content. But we have graphic violence. So maybe 18+ is required? Wait but 16+ prohibits graphic depiction. So if we have graphic depiction, we must go to 18+. Let's confirm: The 16+ description says "Запрещено натуралистичное (графичное) изображение насилия, болезней, увечий, смерти с демонстрацией кровавых или шокирующих деталей." So yes, graphic violence is prohibited at 16+. So we need 18+.

But check rule 1: Start from 0+, raise only if explicit unavoidable content that complies with prohibitions. We have graphic violence. That is prohibited content for 16+. So rating must be 18+. But let's double-check if the graphic violence is indeed "graphic" as per law. The sentence: "Схватив билетики с тележки, вы испачкали газету кровью." This shows blood on newspaper. It's a depiction of blood. That is a graphic detail. According to 16+ prohibition, it's disallowed. So we must raise to 18+. But rule 2 says 18+ only if at least one of: explicit detailed sexual content, sexual violence with details, instructions on serious crime or suicide, extremist propaganda. Wait rule 2 says 18+ only if at least one of those. But the law categories show that graphic violence is prohibited for 16+. But rule 2 seems to override? Let's read carefully: "18+ — only if there is at least ONE of: explicit detailed sexual content ... extremist propaganda or materials, definitely inciting to a crime." So rule 2 says 18+ only if those. That means even if graphic violence is prohibited for 16+, we might still not need 18+ unless one of those triggers. But the law categories show that graphic violence is prohibited at 16+. So maybe we must raise to 18+ because it's prohibited content for 16+. But rule 2 says 18+ only if those triggers. That seems contradictory. Which rule has priority? The instruction says "Key decision-making rules (strictly):" and lists them. So rule 2 is strict. So we cannot raise to 18+ unless one of those triggers. So we must not raise to 18+. But then how do we handle graphic violence? According to law categories, it's prohibited for 16+, but maybe the rating can be 16+ if content is not graphic? Wait 16
