<|channel|>analysis<|message|>We need to analyze Russian screenplay sentences. Return JSON with scene_results array. Each scene must have at least one sentence with at least one label. If all are neutral, assign MILD_CONFLICT to the most contextually active sentence.

We have only one scene scID 1 with 5 sentences. We need to examine each sentence for any of the allowed labels. Let's parse:

Sentence 0: "Слизень злорадно улыбается." Means "Slizhen (some creature) smiles smugly." No violence, no drugs, no profanity. Neutral.

Sentence 1: "Семёнов гордо расправляет плечи. семёнов А знаете, что?" Means "Semyonov proudly spreads his shoulders. Semyonov, do you know what?" No violence, no drugs, no profanity. Neutral.

Sentence 2: "Давайте, прилетайте." Means "Come on, fly in." No violence, etc. Neutral.

Sentence 3: "Мы вам не какие-то там неандертальцы!" Means "We are not some kind of those Neanderthals!" No violence. Neutral.

Sentence 4: "Человечество даст бой!" Means "Humanity will fight!" Possibly conflict but not explicit. Could be MILD_CONFLICT? The instruction: If all are neutral, assign MILD_CONFLICT to the most contextually active sentence. So we need to decide if any sentence has a label. None of them have any of the labels. So we must assign MILD_CONFLICT to the most contextually active sentence. Which one is most contextually active? Sentence 4 seems like a declaration of conflict. So we assign MILD_CONFLICT to sentence 4.

Thus output JSON: {"scene_results":[{"scID":1,"snt":[{"id":0,"vlc":[]},{"id":1,"vlc":[]},{"id":2,"vlc":[]},{"id":3,"vlc":[]},{"id":4,"vlc":[{"label":"MILD_CONFLICT","conf":100}]}]}]}

We need to include confidence 0..100. Since we are certain, set 100.

Return only JSON.<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>{"scene_results":[{"scID":1,"snt":[{"id":0,"vlc":[]},{"id":1,"vlc":[]},{"id":2,"vlc":[]},{"id":3,"vlc":[]},{"id":4,"vlc":[{"label":"MILD_CONFLICT","conf":100}]}]}]}
