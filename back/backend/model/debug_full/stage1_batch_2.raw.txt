<|channel|>analysis<|message|>We need to analyze Russian screenplay sentences. Return JSON with scene_results array. Each scene must have at least one sentence with at least one label. If all are neutral, assign MILD_CONFLICT to the most contextually active sentence.

We have only one scene scID 2 with 4 sentences. We need to determine if any of these sentences contain any of the labels. Let's examine each sentence:

Sentence 0: "Инфемёнов подносит корабль к окну, нажимает кнопку." (typo maybe "Инфемёнов" but anyway). No violence, no drugs, no profanity. It's neutral.

Sentence 1: "Корабль испускает зелёный луч." Neutral.

Sentence 2: "Луч бьёт в заброшенную машину." The beam hits an abandoned car. Could be considered violence? It's a beam hitting a car; not necessarily violent to a person. Might be considered "WEAPONS_USAGE" or "VIOLENCE_NON_GRAPHIC"? The beam is a weapon? But it's not explicitly a weapon used against a person. The label "WEAPONS_USAGE" might apply if there's a weapon used. But the beam is a weapon? It's a ship's beam. Could be considered "WEAPONS_USAGE". But we need to see if any of the allowed labels match. "WEAPONS_USAGE" is allowed. Does the sentence mention a weapon? It says "луч бьёт в заброшенную машину" - a beam hits an abandoned car. That could be considered usage of a weapon (beam). So maybe label "WEAPONS_USAGE". But we need to check if the guidelines say that "weapon usage" includes beams. The label list includes "WEAPONS_USAGE" and "WEAPONS_MENTION". We can assign "WEAPONS_USAGE" with some confidence.

Sentence 3: "Машина испаряется." The car evaporates. This is a result of the beam. Could be considered "MEDICAL_GORE_DETAILS"? No. It's just destruction. Might be "VIOLENCE_NON_GRAPHIC" because it's destruction of property? But maybe not. The guidelines: "VIOLENCE_GRAPHIC: explicit gore/blood/wounds/torture only." Not present. "VIOLENCE_NON_GRAPHIC": non-graphic violence. This could be considered non-graphic violence (destruction). So we might label sentence 3 as "VIOLENCE_NON_GRAPHIC". But we need to decide which sentence is most contextually active. The beam hitting the car and causing it to evaporate is the main action. So maybe assign both sentences 2 and 3 with labels.

But the requirement: Each scene must have at least one sentence with at least one label. We can assign multiple sentences with labels. But we need to ensure at least one. We can assign sentence 2 with "WEAPONS_USAGE" and sentence 3 with "VIOLENCE_NON_GRAPHIC". That satisfies.

We need to provide confidence values 0-100. Let's assign moderate confidence: 80 for WEAPONS_USAGE, 70 for VIOLENCE_NON_GRAPHIC.

But we must ensure that the labels are from allowed list. Yes.

Now produce JSON:

{
"scene_results":[
{"scID":2,"snt":[
{"id":2,"vlc":[{"label":"WEAPONS_USAGE","conf":80}]},
{"id":3,"vlc":[{"label":"VIOLENCE_NON_GRAPHIC","conf":70}]}
]}
]
}

But we need to include all sentences? The output format: "scene_results":[{"scID":int,"snt":[{"id":int,"vlc":[{"label":string,"conf":int}]}]}]. It seems each sentence object must have id and vlc array. We can include only those with labels. But maybe we need to include all sentences? The spec says "Each scene MUST have at least ONE sentence with at least ONE label." It doesn't say we must include all sentences. So we can include only labeled ones.

But the output format expects each snt entry to have id and vlc array. We can include only those with labels. That should be fine.

Let's produce final JSON.<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>{"scene_results":[{"scID":2,"snt":[{"id":2,"vlc":[{"label":"WEAPONS_USAGE","conf":80}]},{"id":3,"vlc":[{"label":"VIOLENCE_NON_GRAPHIC","conf":70}]}]}]}
