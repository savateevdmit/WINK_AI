<|channel|>analysis<|message|>We need to produce JSON with ans array. For each input label produce a det object. Input has one query: scID 1, id 2, pt sentence, t sentence, nt empty, vlc list ["VIOLENCE_GRAPHIC", "MURDER_HOMICIDE"].

We must evaluate severity and score. Use bs values: VIOLENCE_GRAPHIC 90, MURDER_HOMICIDE 70. We need to combine? The system likely sums? The scoring method: scr from bs (+/- brief rationale). Probably we sum the base scores of each label. So 90+70=160. But max 100? Maybe cap at 100. But severity mapping: 0-24 none, 25-49 mild, 50-79 moderate, 80-100 severe. So 160 >100 => severe. But maybe we should average? Not specified. Usually combine by adding and then cap at 100. We'll set scr=100. Provide rationale: graphic depiction of murder with gore.

We need det objects for each label: two labels. Each det includes label, sev, scr, rsn, adv, ok, suggest. For each label we need severity based on bs? Actually severity per label maybe from bs mapping? But we have severity categories: Mild, Moderate, Severe. We can map each label's base score to severity: 90 => Severe, 70 => Severe. So both severe.

But scr field is overall? The spec says "scr from bs (+/- brief rationale)". Might be per det? Probably per det. But we can give scr equal to bs value. Provide rsn: description of why. adv: advice. ok: boolean if acceptable. suggest: null or suggestion.

We need to produce for each label a det object. So two det objects.

Ok: For VIOLENCE_GRAPHIC: sev Severe, scr 90, rsn "Graphic depiction of gore and blood." adv "Consider removing graphic details." ok false? The content is graphic violence; maybe acceptable? But policy likely disallows graphic violence. So ok false. Suggest: "VIOLENCE_GRAPHIC_MITIGATE" or "REMOVE". Use suggestion maybe "VIOLENCE_GRAPHIC_MITIGATE". For MURDER_HOMICIDE: sev Severe, scr 70, rsn "Depicts murder." adv "Consider removing or reducing depiction." ok false. Suggest "MURDER_HOMICIDE_REMOVE".

Return JSON.
