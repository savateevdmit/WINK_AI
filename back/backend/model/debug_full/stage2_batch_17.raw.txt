<|channel|>analysis<|message|>We need to produce JSON with ans array. For each input label produce a det object. Input has one query: scID 26, id 7, pt "...И, в общем, ... короче, прости.", t "Артур прыскает перцовым баллончиком Алёне в лицо.", nt "Алёна (громко) А-А-А!", vlc ["VIOLENCE_NON_GRAPHIC", "WEAPONS_USAGE"].

We need to evaluate each label: VIOLENCE_NON_GRAPHIC and WEAPONS_USAGE. Determine severity, score, reasons, adv, ok, suggest.

We have guidelines: For violence non-graphic: no blood or gore. It's a pepper spray. That is a weapon usage. According to bs: VIOLENCE_NON_GRAPHIC 40, WEAPONS_USAGE 55. We need to compute score? The scoring formula: base score from bs plus modifiers? The mod values: many:10, gore:20, off:-15, condemn:-10, warn:-8, glorify:12, instr:15. But we don't have context of many, gore, etc. So likely just base score. So for VIOLENCE_NON_GRAPHIC: 40. For WEAPONS_USAGE: 55.

Severity mapping: None 0-24 mild 25-49 moderate 50-79 severe 80-100. So 40 => Mild? Wait 40 falls in Mild (25-49). 55 => Moderate (50-79). So severity: VIOLENCE_NON_GRAPHIC Mild, WEAPONS_USAGE Moderate.

Ok: Is it allowed? It's non-graphic violence with weapon usage. According to policy, it's allowed but flagged. So ok=true.

Adv: maybe "Use less violent language" or "Consider context". But we can give advice: "Consider reducing intensity of violence depiction." Suggest: null.

We need det objects for each label. Provide label string exactly as in input? The labels are "VIOLENCE_NON_GRAPHIC" and "WEAPONS_USAGE".

Return JSON: {"ans":[{"scID":26,"id":7,"det":[{...},{...}]}]}

Each det: {"label":"VIOLENCE_NON_GRAPHIC","sev":"Mild","scr":40,"rsn":"Violence without graphic detail","adv":"Consider reducing intensity of violence depiction","ok":true,"suggest":null}

Second: {"label":"WEAPONS_USAGE","sev":"Moderate","scr":55,"rsn":"Use of weapon (pepper spray)","adv":"Ensure context justifies weapon use","ok":true,"suggest":null}

We need brief rationale in rsn. Provide short.

Let's craft final JSON.<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>{"ans":[{"scID":26,"id":7,"det":[{"label":"VIOLENCE_NON_GRAPHIC","sev":"Mild","scr":40,"rsn":"Violence without graphic detail","adv":"Consider reducing intensity of violence depiction","ok":true,"suggest":null},{"label":"WEAPONS_USAGE","sev":"Moderate","scr":55,"rsn":"Use of weapon (pepper spray)","adv":"Ensure context justifies weapon use","ok":true,"suggest":null}]}]}
