<|channel|>analysis<|message|>We need to analyze Russian screenplay sentences. Return JSON with scene_results array. Each scene must have at least one sentence with at least one label. If all are neutral, assign MILD_CONFLICT to the most contextually active sentence.

We have scene 15 with 11 sentences (id 0-10). We need to detect any of the allowed labels. Let's examine each sentence:

0: "Слизень пульсирует, переливается всеми цветами радуги." This is describing a slime pulsating rainbow colors. No violence, drugs, profanity. Neutral.

1: "Семёнов смущён." Means "Semyonov is embarrassed." Neutral.

2: "Это потрясающе!" "This is amazing!" Neutral.

3: "Как называется эта эмоция?" "What is this emotion called?" Neutral.

4: "СЕМЁНОВ (смущённо) Никак." "Semyonov (embarrassed) No way." Neutral.

5: "Эмоция и эмоция. слизень (КАЙФУЯ) Аааааа..." "Emotion and emotion. slime (KAYFUA) Aaaaa..." Possibly slang? "Кайф" means pleasure, but not profanity. Neutral.

6: "Это бесподобно!" "This is unparalleled!" Neutral.

7: "Почему ты её от меня скрывал?!" "Why did you hide it from me?!" Neutral.

8: "Простите, но я не буду с Вами это обсуждать." "Sorry, but I will not discuss this with you." Neutral.

9: "Это сугубо личное..." "This is purely personal..." Neutral.

10: "Семёнов молча тупит взгляд." "Semyonov silently stares." Neutral.

Thus all sentences are neutral. According to rule: If all are neutral, assign MILD_CONFLICT to the most contextually active sentence. Which one is most contextually active? Possibly sentence 7 or 8? Sentence 7 expresses conflict: "Why did you hide it from me?" That indicates conflict. So we should label that sentence with MILD_CONFLICT.

We must produce JSON:

{
"scene_results":[
{"scID":15,"snt":[{"id":7,"vlc":[{"label":"MILD_CONFLICT","conf":100}]}]}
]
}

But we need to include all sentences? The format: "snt":[{"id":int,"vlc":[{"label":string,"conf":int}]}]. It seems each sentence object must have id and vlc array. But the requirement: Each scene MUST have at least ONE sentence with at least ONE label. So we can include only the labeled sentence? The spec says "Return ONLY JSON: {"scene_results":[{"scID":int,"snt":[{"id":int,"vlc":[{"label":string,"conf":int}]}]}]}" So each scene has snt array of sentences with labels. It doesn't say we must include all sentences, but likely we should include only those with labels. But to be safe, we can include all sentences but only label the one with MILD_CONFLICT. However the spec says "Each scene MUST have at least ONE sentence with at least ONE label." So we could include all sentences but only label one. But that might produce many unlabeled sentences with empty vlc arrays? The spec doesn't forbid empty vlc arrays, but maybe we should not include them. Let's interpret: We need to return JSON with scene_results array. Each scene has scID and snt array of sentences that have labels. So we can include only the labeled sentence(s). That satisfies requirement.

Thus output:

{
"scene_results":[
{"scID":15,"snt":[{"id":7,"vlc":[{"label":"MILD_CONFLICT","conf":100}]}]}
]
}

We need to ensure JSON is valid. Provide final answer.<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>{"scene_results":[{"scID":15,"snt":[{"id":7,"vlc":[{"label":"MILD_CONFLICT","conf":100}]}]}]}
