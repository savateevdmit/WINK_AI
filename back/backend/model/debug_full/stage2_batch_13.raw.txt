<|channel|>analysis<|message|>We need to produce JSON with ans array. For each input label produce a det object. Input: scID 21, id 9, pt sentence, t sentence, nt sentence, vlc list ["VIOLENCE_NON_GRAPHIC"]. So we have one label: VIOLENCE_NON_GRAPHIC. We must evaluate severity and score.

We need to compute base score from bs: VIOLENCE_NON_GRAPHIC = 40. Then apply modifiers? The text: "Алёна толкает Артура за угол." That's a mild non-graphic violence. So base 40. Modifiers: maybe "many" or "off"? Not present. So final score 40. Severity mapping: 40 falls into Mild (25-49). So severity Mild.

We need to produce det object with fields: label, sev, scr, rsn, adv, ok, suggest. For each input label produce a det object. So one det.

We need rsn: reason string. Provide explanation: "Non-graphic physical aggression without blood or injury." adv: advice? maybe "Consider reducing violence or providing context." ok: boolean true if acceptable. Since mild non-graphic violence is allowed, ok=true. suggest: null.

Return JSON: {"ans":[{"scID":21,"id":9,"det":[{"label":"VIOLENCE_NON_GRAPHIC","sev":"Mild","scr":40,"rsn":"Non-graphic physical aggression without blood or injury.","adv":"Consider reducing violence or providing context if needed.","ok":true,"suggest":null}]}]}

Check format: ans array of objects each with scID, id, det array. Yes.

Return only JSON.<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>{"ans":[{"scID":21,"id":9,"det":[{"label":"VIOLENCE_NON_GRAPHIC","sev":"Mild","scr":40,"rsn":"Non-graphic physical aggression without blood or injury.","adv":"Consider reducing violence or providing context if needed.","ok":true,"suggest":null}]}]}
