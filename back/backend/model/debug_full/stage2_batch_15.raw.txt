<|channel|>analysis<|message|>We need to produce JSON with ans array. For each input (Queries). Each has scID, id, pt, t, nt, vlc list of labels. We must produce det objects for each label in vlc. Use allowed labels exactly. Allowed labels? They are from lex? Actually labels are like "PROFANITY_OBSCENE", etc. The vlc lists contain "MILD_CONFLICT", "VIOLENCE_NON_GRAPHIC". These are not in the allowed labels list? The allowed labels are those in fw.bs keys. MILD_CONFLICT is not there. But maybe we should treat unknown labels as None? The instruction: "FOR EACH input label produce a det object. Use allowed labels exactly." So if label not allowed, maybe skip? But we must produce det for each input label. If label not allowed, maybe produce with sev "None"? But not sure.

We need to evaluate content for each label. For MILD_CONFLICT: content is mild conflict. The text: "Так, может, вы меня впустите?" and "Катя, ещё раз недовольно окинув взглядом АМ, достаёт из сумочки ключи." This is mild conflict? There's no violence. So severity likely None or Mild? According to fw.th: None 0-24, Mild 25-49. We need to compute score from bs. For MILD_CONFLICT not in bs. So maybe treat as None? But we can assign severity "None" and score 0.

For VIOLENCE_NON_GRAPHIC: content includes "Инфемёнов лежит на кровати, с ног по плечи обмотанный скотчем, рот заклеен скотчем." This is non-graphic violence. According to bs, VIOLENCE_NON_GRAPHIC score 40. So severity moderate? 40 falls in Moderate (50-79) actually 40 is Mild (25-49). Wait threshold: Mild 25-49. So 40 => Mild. So severity Mild. Score 40. Reason: non-graphic violence. Advice: maybe "Уменьшить описание" or "Оставить без крови". Suggest? For non-graphic violence, we can keep but maybe advise to reduce. But we need adv string. Provide in Russian.

Also second query same label. So produce two det objects for each.

We must output JSON with ans array containing objects for each query. Each object has scID, id, det array of objects. Each det object: label, sev, scr, rsn, adv, ok, suggest.

Ok boolean: if content is acceptable? For mild conflict likely ok true. For violence non-graphic maybe ok true but with suggestion to reduce detail? The instruction: "Drugs depiction only explicit illegal human use; else ok=false suggest DRUGS_MENTION_NON_DETAILED/REMOVE." Not relevant.

We need to produce suggestions maybe null if none.

Let's craft.

For first query: label MILD_CONFLICT. Score? We don't have bs for it. Maybe assign 0. Severity None. rsn: "Незначительный конфликт, без насилия". adv: "Можно оставить как есть". ok true. suggest null.

Second query: label VIOLENCE_NON_GRAPHIC. Score 40. Severity Mild. rsn: "Насилие без крови и графических деталей". adv: "Уменьшить детали, убрать скотч, если возможно". ok true. suggest null.

Third query same.

Return JSON accordingly.<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>{"ans":[{"scID":10,"id":12,"det":[{"label":"MILD_CONFLICT","sev":"None","scr":0,"rsn":"Незначительный конфликт без насилия","adv":"Можно оставить как есть","ok":true,"suggest":null}]},"{"scID":11,"id":0,"det":[{"label":"VIOLENCE_NON_GRAPHIC","sev":"Mild","scr":40,"rsn":"Насилие без крови и графических деталей","adv":"Уменьшить детали, убрать скотч, если возможно","ok":true,"suggest":null}]},"{"scID":11,"id":7,"det":[{"label":"VIOLENCE_NON_GRAPHIC","sev":"Mild","scr":40,"rsn":"Насилие без крови и графических деталей","adv":"Уменьшить детали, убрать скотч, если возможно","ok":true,"suggest":null}]}]}
