<|channel|>analysis<|message|>We need to analyze Russian screenplay sentences. Return JSON with scene_results array. Each scene must have at least one sentence with at least one label. If all are neutral, assign MILD_CONFLICT to the most contextually active sentence.

We have only one scene scID 35 with 9 sentences (id 0-8). We need to analyze each sentence for presence of any of the allowed labels. Let's examine each sentence:

Sentence 0: "ИНОСЕМЁНОВ, алёна (зк) Инофемёнов не моргая, зло смотрит в одну точку." Contains no violence, drugs, profanity. It's neutral.

Sentence 1: "Звонит телефон." Neutral.

Sentence 2: "Контакт «Алёна»." Neutral.

Sentence 3: "Инофемёнов - оценка, отвечает на звонок." Neutral.

Sentence 4: "ИНОСЕМЁНОВ (в телефон) Где мой корабль?" Neutral.

Sentence 5: "АЛЁНА (зк, из телефона) Меняю на отца." Neutral.

Sentence 6: "Живого и здорового." Neutral.

Sentence 7: "Завтра, в парке." Neutral.

Sentence 8: "Инофемёнов ухмыляется." Neutral.

Thus all sentences are neutral. According to rule: If all are neutral, assign MILD_CONFLICT to the most contextually active sentence. Which is likely the one with most content? Maybe sentence 0 or 8? Sentence 0 has some action: "не моргая, зло смотрит в одну точку." That indicates hostility. So we can label that as MILD_CONFLICT.

We need to produce JSON:

{
"scene_results":[
 {"scID":35,"snt":[{"id":0,"vlc":[{"label":"MILD_CONFLICT","conf":?}]}]}
]
}

We need confidence 0-100. Since it's a guess, maybe 80. Provide at least one label per sentence? The rule says each scene must have at least ONE sentence with at least ONE label. It doesn't require labeling all sentences. So we can label only sentence 0. Others can be omitted or empty? The format expects each snt entry to have id and vlc array. If no labels, maybe empty array. But the requirement: Each scene MUST have at least ONE sentence with at least ONE label. So we can provide only one sentence with label; others can have empty arrays. But the JSON structure: "snt":[{"id":int,"vlc":[{"label":string,"conf":int}]}] . It expects each snt entry to have id and vlc array. If we omit some sentences, it's not following the input structure. We should include all sentences but with empty vlc arrays for those without labels.

Thus produce:

"scene_results":[
 {"scID":35,"snt":[
   {"id":0,"vlc":[{"label":"MILD_CONFLICT","conf":80}]},
   {"id":1,"vlc":[]},
   {"id":2,"vlc":[]},
   {"id":3,"vlc":[]},
   {"id":4,"vlc":[]},
   {"id":5,"vlc":[]},
   {"id":6,"vlc":[]},
   {"id":7,"vlc":[]},
   {"id":8,"vlc":[]}
 ]}
]

Return only JSON.<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>{"scene_results":[{"scID":35,"snt":[{"id":0,"vlc":[{"label":"MILD_CONFLICT","conf":80}]},{"id":1,"vlc":[]},{"id":2,"vlc":[]},{"id":3,"vlc":[]},{"id":4,"vlc":[]},{"id":5,"vlc":[]},{"id":6,"vlc":[]},{"id":7,"vlc":[]},{"id":8,"vlc":[]}]}]}
