<|channel|>analysis<|message|>We need to analyze each sentence for labels. Provide JSON with scene_results array. Each scene has scID and snt array of objects with id and vlc array of label/conf pairs.

We must assign at least one label per scene. If all sentences are neutral, assign MILD_CONFLICT to most contextually active sentence. But here there are violent actions: "он Олега с балкона одной рукой вышвырнул" (someone threw Oleg from balcony). That is violence. Also "перцовый баллончик" maybe non-graphic. There's also mention of "потеря" etc. Also "пошутить нельзя?" no. There's no explicit gore. So we can label MURDER_HOMICIDE? The action: "вышвырнул" could be assault but not necessarily homicide. But it's violent. We have "VIOLENCE_NON_GRAPHIC" maybe. Also "перцовый баллончик" is a weapon usage. So WEAPONS_USAGE. Also "вышвырнул" might be violence. So label VIOLENCE_NON_GRAPHIC.

Also "пошутить нельзя?" no. There's no profanity. No drugs. So only labels: VIOLENCE_NON_GRAPHIC, WEAPONS_USAGE maybe. Also "перцовый баллончик" is a weapon. So we can assign both.

We need to decide which sentence is most contextually active. Sentence 1: "Слушай, я понимаю, это всё звучит как бред, но когда он Олега с балкона одной рукой вышвырнул, я сама офигела..." This contains violence. So we can label that.

Also sentence 2: "АРТУР (с явным скепсисом) Ага, а потом он вырубился от перцового баллончика?" That references the same event. Could also be labeled.

We need to assign at least one label per scene. We can assign labels to multiple sentences. But each sentence may have zero or more labels. The requirement: Each scene MUST have at least ONE sentence with at least ONE label. So we can choose to label only one sentence, but we can label multiple. It's okay.

We need to produce JSON with scene_results array. For each sentence, we need id and vlc array of objects with label and conf. Conf is integer 0-100. We can assign e.g., 90 for confidence.

Let's identify sentences that contain violence or weapons:

Sentence id 1: "Слушай, я понимаю, это всё звучит как бред, но когда он Олега с балкона одной рукой вышвырнул, я сама офигела..." => VIOLENCE_NON_GRAPHIC, WEAPONS_USAGE? The action is throwing someone off balcony. That's violence but not necessarily weapon. But we can label VIOLENCE_NON_GRAPHIC.

Sentence id 2: "АРТУР (с явным скепсисом) Ага, а потом он вырубился от перцового баллончика?" => WEAPONS_USAGE, maybe VIOLENCE_NON_GRAPHIC? The mention of pepper spray. So WEAPONS_USAGE.

Also sentence id 1 also includes "вышвырнул" which is violent. So we can label both.

We might also consider sentence id 1 as MURDER_HOMICIDE? Not necessarily homicide. It's assault. So not homicide.

Thus we assign labels accordingly.

We need to produce JSON with each sentence's vlc array. For sentences without labels, we can leave empty array? The spec says each scene must have at least one sentence with at least one label. It doesn't say we cannot have empty arrays for others. But we should include them anyway. So for each sentence, we provide id and vlc array. If no labels, empty array.

We need to produce final JSON only. Let's craft.

Scene 21.

We'll assign:

id 1: labels: VIOLENCE_NON_GRAPHIC (conf 90), WEAPONS_USAGE? Actually the action is throwing, not weapon. But we can still include WEAPONS_USAGE? The mention of "перцовый баллончик" is in sentence 2. So maybe only VIOLENCE_NON_GRAPHIC for id1.

id 2: labels: WEAPONS_USAGE (conf 85). Also maybe VIOLENCE_NON_GRAPHIC? The pepper spray used to incapacitate. Could be considered violence. But we can include both.

We could also label id 2 with VIOLENCE_NON_GRAPHIC as well. Let's do that.

Thus:

id 1: vlc: [{"label":"VIOLENCE_NON_GRAPHIC","conf":90}]

id 2: vlc: [{"label":"WEAPONS_USAGE","conf":85},{"label":"VIOLENCE_NON_GRAPHIC","conf":80}]

All other sentences: empty array.

We must ensure JSON format correct. Provide scene_results array with one object.
