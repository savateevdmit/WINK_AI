<|channel|>analysis<|message|>We need to analyze each sentence for labels. Provide JSON with scene_results array. Each scene has scID and snt array of objects with id and vlc array of label/conf pairs.

We must assign at least one label per scene. If all sentences are neutral, assign MILD_CONFLICT to most contextually active sentence. But we have some conflict: "Рядом с деревом падает Олег." implies Oleg falls? Could be death? "Олег стонет, взявшись за руку." indicates injury. There's also "Алёна и Артур прячутся под балконом с кораблём." They are hiding. "Алёна с Артуром убегают." They run away. So conflict present. We can label MURDER_HOMICIDE? Not clear. Oleg falls from tree maybe due to something. Could be accident. But we have "падает" (falls). Might be injury. Could be "VIOLENCE_NON_GRAPHIC" or "MILD_CONFLICT". Let's analyze each sentence:

id0: "Алёна и Артур прячутся под балконом с кораблём. артур (с одышкой) А могли бы в отель сейчас заселяться..." They are hiding, no violence.

id1: "Рядом с деревом падает Олег." Oleg falls near tree. Could be injury. Not explicit gore. So maybe "VIOLENCE_NON_GRAPHIC" or "MILD_CONFLICT". But "падает" could be accident. Might be "VIOLENCE_NON_GRAPHIC" if it's a violent act. But we don't know cause. I'd label "VIOLENCE_NON_GRAPHIC" with moderate confidence.

id2: "Алёна с Артуром в шоке." No violence.

id3: "Ааа!!!" no.

id4: "Рука!!! алёна (шёпотом) Валим!" Not clear.

id5: "Алёна с Артуром убегают. катя (с балкона) Олег!" They run away, Oleg maybe from balcony? Could be conflict.

id6: "Ты живой?" question.

id7: "Олег стонет, взявшись за руку." Oleg is in pain, maybe injured. So violence.

Thus we can assign "VIOLENCE_NON_GRAPHIC" to id1 and id7. Also maybe "MURDER_HOMICIDE" if Oleg's fall leads to death? Not explicit. So not.

We need at least one label per scene. We have labels for some sentences. Good.

Now produce JSON:

scene_results: array with one object scID 34, snt array of objects id and vlc array.

For each sentence we include only those with labels. But requirement: Each scene must have at least ONE sentence with at least ONE label. So we can include all sentences but only label those that have. For neutral sentences, we could leave empty vlc? The format expects each snt object has id and vlc array. If no labels, maybe empty array. But we might skip them? The spec: "Return ONLY JSON: {"scene_results":[{"scID":int,"snt":[{"id":int,"vlc":[{"label":string,"conf":int}]}]}]}" So each snt must have id and vlc array. We can include empty array for neutral sentences. But we need at least one sentence with label. We'll provide labels for id1 and id7.

Confidence: maybe 80 for violence non-graphic. Provide conf 80.

Let's produce JSON accordingly.<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>{"scene_results":[{"scID":34,"snt":[{"id":0,"vlc":[]},{"id":1,"vlc":[{"label":"VIOLENCE_NON_GRAPHIC","conf":80}]},{"id":2,"vlc":[]},{"id":3,"vlc":[]},{"id":4,"vlc":[]},{"id":5,"vlc":[]},{"id":6,"vlc":[]},{"id":7,"vlc":[{"label":"VIOLENCE_NON_GRAPHIC","conf":80}]}]}]}
