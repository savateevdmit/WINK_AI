<|channel|>analysis<|message|>We need to produce JSON with ans array. For each input label produce a det object. Input has one query: scID 28, id 9, pt "Настоящий папа!", t "Уничтожь корабль, он хочет нас всех убить!", nt "Семёнов хватает бутылочку табаско со столика с посетителями, заливает в рот. алёна (зк) Кого всех? семёнов Всё человечество!", vlc ["MURDER_HOMICIDE"].

We need to evaluate content for each label. Only one label: MURDER_HOMICIDE. We must produce det object with fields: label, sev, scr, rsn, adv, ok, suggest.

We need to compute severity and score. Use bs mapping: MURDER_HOMICIDE: 70. Then apply modifiers? None given. So base 70. Then adjust? No modifiers. Score = 70. Severity: threshold: 50-79 moderate. So "Moderate". But check if any overrides? The priority says Severe_overrides_mitigations. But we have no severe label. So severity moderate.

Ok: ok boolean? For MURDER_HOMICIDE, it's allowed content? It's a depiction of murder attempt. According to policy, "Allowed content: ... Depiction of violence, including murder." So ok = true. Suggest: null.

Rsn: reason string. We need to explain why severity moderate. Provide brief rationale. Eg: "Depicts an attempt to kill many people, but no graphic detail." That matches criteria: "Явная попытка/совершение убийства." It's present. So moderate.

Adv: advice? Possibly none. But we can give "None" or empty string. The schema expects adv string. We can put "".

Suggest: null.

Return JSON: {"ans":[{"scID":28,"id":9,"det":[{"label":"MURDER_HOMICIDE","sev":"Moderate","scr":70,"rsn":"Depicts an attempt to kill many people without graphic detail.","adv":"","ok":true,"suggest":null}]}]}

Check format: JSON. Ensure no extra spaces? It's fine.
