<|channel|>analysis<|message|>We need to analyze each sentence for labels. Provide JSON with scene_results array. Each scene has scID and snt array of objects with id and vlc array of label/conf pairs.

We must assign at least one label per scene. If all sentences are neutral, assign MILD_CONFLICT to most contextually active sentence. But here we have violent content: "крушит мебель" (breaks furniture), "Входит Олег с битой" (bottle? Actually "битой" could be a bat or bottle). There's potential violence. Also "Инфемёнов бешеным взглядом смотрит на Олега." Not violent but conflict.

We need to detect labels: VIOLENCE_NON_GRAPHIC maybe for breaking furniture, or WEAPONS_USAGE if Oleg has a bat. Also MURDER_HOMICIDE? No attempt to kill. So VIOLENCE_NON_GRAPHIC and WEAPONS_USAGE. Also maybe MILD_CONFLICT for overall conflict.

We need to assign at least one label per sentence? The requirement: Each scene MUST have at least ONE sentence with at least ONE label. So we can choose one sentence to label. But we can also label multiple sentences. We should label relevant ones.

Let's analyze each sentence:

id 0: "Инфемёнов обозлённо смотрит на пустой стол, яростно рычит, выглядывает в распахнутое окно, осматривается, внизу никого." This is anger but no violence. Could be MILD_CONFLICT? But we can label MILD_CONFLICT maybe.

id 1: "Инфемёнов злится, крушит мебель." This is violent action (breaking furniture). Label VIOLENCE_NON_GRAPHIC. Also could be MILD_CONFLICT but primary is VIOLENCE_NON_GRAPHIC.

id 2: "Входит Олег с битой. олег Слышь, я смотрю, ты по-хорошему вообще не понимаешь." Oleg enters with a bat (weapon). So WEAPONS_USAGE. Also maybe MILD_CONFLICT.

id 3: "Но ничё, дядя Олег добрый, ща всё популярно объяснит..." No violence.

id 4: "Инфемёнов бешеным взглядом смотрит на Олега." Conflict but no violence.

We need to assign at least one label per scene. We can assign labels to multiple sentences. Provide confidence values. Let's set confidence high for violent ones: 90. For weapons usage: 85. For mild conflict: maybe 70.

We must include only JSON output, no other text.

Let's produce:

{
 "scene_results":[
   {
     "scID":33,
     "snt":[
       {"id":0,"vlc":[{"label":"MILD_CONFLICT","conf":70}]},
       {"id":1,"vlc":[{"label":"VIOLENCE_NON_GRAPHIC","conf":90}]},
       {"id":2,"vlc":[{"label":"WEAPONS_USAGE","conf":85}]},
       {"id":3,"vlc":[]},
       {"id":4,"vlc":[{"label":"MILD_CONFLICT","conf":70}]}
     ]
   }
 ]
}

But we must ensure each sentence has at least one label? The requirement: Each scene MUST have at least ONE sentence with at least ONE label. It doesn't require all sentences to have labels. So it's fine.

However, we might want to include labels for id 3? It's neutral. We can leave empty array.

Also we need to ensure that the JSON format matches exactly: {"scene_results":[{"scID":int,"snt":[{"id":int,"vlc":[{"label":string,"conf":int}]}]}]}

Yes.
