<|channel|>analysis<|message|>We need to analyze Russian screenplay sentences. Return JSON with scene_results array. Each scene has scID and snt array of objects with id and vlc array of label/conf pairs.

We must assign at least one label per sentence? Actually each scene MUST have at least ONE sentence with at least ONE label. If all are neutral, assign MILD_CONFLICT to the most contextually active sentence. So we can label some sentences. We need to detect labels from allowed list based on content.

Input: scID 0, sentences 0-5.

Let's analyze each sentence:

Sentence 0: "Инофемёнов за столом, перед ним корабль." (typo maybe). No violence, no drugs, etc. Neutral.

Sentence 1: "Из носа торчат щупальца, при помощи ножниц, заколки, шпильки и пинцета ковыряются в корабле." This describes using scissors, hairpins, pins, tweezers to poke into a ship? It's weird. There's mention of tools but no violence or gore. Could be "WEAPONS_USAGE" maybe? But these are not weapons. They are tools. Not violence. Might be "CRIMINAL_ACTIVITY"? No. So neutral.

Sentence 2: "Корабль искрит, «оживает», переливается огнями." Neutral.

Sentence 3: "Щупальца втягиваются в нос, Инофемёнов зловеще улыбается." Neutral.

Sentence 4: "Инофемёнов (довольно) Ну, вот и всё." Neutral.

Sentence 5: "Можете считать часы до своей смерти." This is a threat? It's telling someone to count hours until their death. Could be "MURDER_HOMICIDE" or "CRIME_INSTRUCTIONS"? It's a threat but not explicit instructions. Might be "MURDER_HOMICIDE" as clear attempt or commission? The sentence says "You can count the hours until your death." That implies threat of death. So maybe "MURDER_HOMICIDE" or "SUICIDE_SELF_HARM"? No, it's threatening someone else. So "MURDER_HOMICIDE" seems appropriate.

We need at least one sentence with a label. Sentence 5 qualifies. We can assign MURDER_HOMICIDE with confidence maybe 80.

Check other sentences: none have violence or drugs. So only sentence 5 gets label.

Return JSON:

{
"scene_results":[
{"scID":0,"snt":[
{"id":0,"vlc":[]},
{"id":1,"vlc":[]},
{"id":2,"vlc":[]},
{"id":3,"vlc":[]},
{"id":4,"vlc":[]},
{"id":5,"vlc":[{"label":"MURDER_HOMICIDE","conf":80}]}
]}
]

But we must ensure each scene has at least one sentence with at least one label. Yes.

We need to include only JSON, no other text. Ensure proper formatting.

Let's produce final answer.<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>{"scene_results":[{"scID":0,"snt":[{"id":0,"vlc":[]},{"id":1,"vlc":[]},{"id":2,"vlc":[]},{"id":3,"vlc":[]},{"id":4,"vlc":[]},{"id":5,"vlc":[{"label":"MURDER_HOMICIDE","conf":80}]}]}]}
