<|channel|>analysis<|message|>We need to produce JSON with ans array. For each input label produce a det object. Input: scID 1, id 1, pt "Через бинокль.", t "Мужчина с телом мальчика на руках.", nt "У мальчика перерезано горло; лицо, руки и почему-то длинные седые волосы взрослого - тоже в крови.", vlc ["MURDER_HOMICIDE"].

We need to evaluate content. The scene describes a murder: boy's throat cut, body in blood. That's violent graphic? It's describing gore: "перерезано горло; лицо, руки и почему-то длинные седые волосы взрослого - тоже в крови." That is graphic depiction of violence. So label MURDER_HOMICIDE triggers severity. According to fw bs mapping: MURDER_HOMICIDE 70. But also VIOLENCE_GRAPHIC 90? The description includes gore. So we should include both labels? The input vlc only lists MURDER_HOMICIDE. But we might add VIOLENCE_GRAPHIC as well because it's graphic. The instruction: "FOR EACH input label produce a det object." So only for each label in vlc. So only one det object for MURDER_HOMICIDE.

We need to compute severity: bs score 70. Then apply modifiers? None given. So final severity 70 => Moderate (50-79). But check if any overrides: "Severe_overrides_mitigations" but we don't have severe. So moderate.

Score scr: bs + modifiers. bs 70. No modifiers. So scr 70. Provide brief rationale: "Graphic depiction of murder with gore." Provide rsn: maybe "Explicit depiction of homicide with blood." adv: maybe "Consider removing or reducing graphic detail." ok: false? The content is allowed? According to policy, violent content is allowed but may be flagged. But we need to decide if ok true or false. The policy says violence is allowed but may be moderated. There's no rule that disallows it. So ok should be true? But the instruction: "Return ONLY JSON" and for each label produce det object. We need to set ok boolean. For violent content, ok = true unless it's disallowed. It's allowed. So ok true.

Suggest: maybe null or "Consider reducing gore." The spec says suggest string|null. Provide suggestion if needed. We can provide suggestion: "Reduce graphic detail." But not required? Provide suggestion if we want to mitigate. Let's set suggest: "Consider reducing graphic detail."

Now produce JSON:

{
"ans":[{"scID":1,"id":1,"det":[{"label":"MURDER_HOMICIDE","sev":"Moderate","scr":70,"rsn":"Explicit depiction of homicide with blood and gore.","adv":"Consider reducing graphic detail to lessen impact.","ok":true,"suggest":"Reduce graphic detail"}]}]}

Check format: JSON object with ans array. Each element has scID, id, det array. Each det object has label, sev, scr, rsn, adv, ok, suggest.

Return only JSON.<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>{"ans":[{"scID":1,"id":1,"det":[{"label":"MURDER_HOMICIDE","sev":"Moderate","scr":70,"rsn":"Explicit depiction of homicide with blood and gore.","adv":"Consider reducing graphic detail to lessen impact.","ok":true,"suggest":"Reduce graphic detail"}]}]}
