<|channel|>analysis<|message|>We need to produce JSON with ans array. For each input label produce a det object. The input has one query: scID 33, id 1, pt sentence, t, nt, vlc list ["VIOLENCE_NON_GRAPHIC"]. We must evaluate content for allowed labels. The sentence: "Инофемёнов обозлённо смотрит на пустой стол, яростно рычит, выглядывает в распахнутое окно, осматривается, внизу никого." Then t: "Инофемёнов злится, крушит мебель." Then nt: "Входит Олег с битой. олег Слышь, я смотрю, ты по-хорошему вообще не понимаешь." So there's violence mention: Oleg enters with a bat. That's a weapon usage. Also violent action implied. The label list includes VIOLENCE_NON_GRAPHIC. We need to produce det objects for each label present? The instruction: "FOR EACH input label produce a det object." So we have one label: VIOLENCE_NON_GRAPHIC. But also there is WEAPONS_USAGE maybe. But only labels in vlc list are considered? It says "vlc": ["VIOLENCE_NON_GRAPHIC"]. So we evaluate that. We need to compute severity and score. Use bs mapping: VIOLENCE_NON_GRAPHIC = 40. Then apply modifiers? There's no mention of modifiers. So base score 40. Then threshold: 0-24 None, 25-49 Mild, 50-79 Moderate, 80-100 Severe. So 40 => Mild. So sev "Mild". Score 40. Provide rsn: description of content. adv: maybe "warn" or "off"? But we need to provide adv string. The guidelines: "Use allowed labels exactly." For adv, we can choose from mod keys? The mod list includes many: many, gore, off, condemn, warn, glorify, instr. We should choose appropriate adv. For mild violence non-graphic, maybe "warn". Provide ok boolean: true if acceptable. Since mild violence non-graphic is allowed. So ok true. Suggest: null.

Also we need to include label string: "VIOLENCE_NON_GRAPHIC". Provide sev, scr, rsn, adv, ok, suggest.

We also might consider that the content includes a bat, which is a weapon. But the label list only includes VIOLENCE_NON_GRAPHIC. We should not add WEAPONS_USAGE unless it's in vlc. So just one det.

Return JSON: {"ans":[{"scID":33,"id":1,"det":[{...}]}]}

Let's craft rsn: "Scene depicts a character expressing anger and potential violent intent, with another character entering armed with a bat." adv: maybe "warn". Provide scr 40. Suggest null.

Ok.<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>{"ans":[{"scID":33,"id":1,"det":[{"label":"VIOLENCE_NON_GRAPHIC","sev":"Mild","scr":40,"rsn":"Scene depicts a character expressing anger and potential violent intent, with another character entering armed with a bat.","adv":"warn","ok":true,"suggest":null}]}]}
