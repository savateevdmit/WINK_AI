<|channel|>analysis<|message|>We need to analyze Russian screenplay sentences. Return JSON with scene_results array. Each scene must have at least one sentence with at least one label. If all are neutral, assign MILD_CONFLICT to the most contextually active sentence.

We have input: scene 3, two sentences.

Sentence 0: "Семёнов в шоке, смотрит на опустевшее парковочное место. семёнов Ну, может и не очень долгий, но бой..." This seems neutral, maybe mild conflict? There's mention of "шок" but no violence. Sentence 1: "Слизень самодовольно ухмыляется." Also neutral.

Thus all sentences are neutral. We must assign MILD_CONFLICT to the most contextually active sentence. Which is more active? Sentence 0 seems more contextually active because it describes shock and a location, maybe conflict. So we label sentence 0 with MILD_CONFLICT. Sentence 1 remains unlabeled? The requirement: Each scene MUST have at least ONE sentence with at least ONE label. So we can label only sentence 0. Sentence 1 can be omitted or left empty. But the output format expects each sentence object to have id and vlc array. If no labels, maybe empty array? But requirement says each scene must have at least one sentence with at least one label. It doesn't say all sentences must have labels. So we can leave sentence 1 with empty vlc.

Thus output:

{
"scene_results":[
{"scID":3,"snt":[{"id":0,"vlc":[{"label":"MILD_CONFLICT","conf":100}]},{"id":1,"vlc":[]}]
}
]
}

Confidence 100? We can set 100. Provide JSON only.<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>{"scene_results":[{"scID":3,"snt":[{"id":0,"vlc":[{"label":"MILD_CONFLICT","conf":100}]},{"id":1,"vlc":[]}] }]}
