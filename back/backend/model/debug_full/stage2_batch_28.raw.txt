<|channel|>analysis<|message|>We need to produce JSON with ans array. For each input label produce a det object. Input: scID 34, id 7, pt "Ты живой?", t "Олег стонет, взявшись за руку.", nt "", vlc ["VIOLENCE_NON_GRAPHIC"]. So we have one label: VIOLENCE_NON_GRAPHIC.

We need to compute severity and score. Use bs mapping: VIOLENCE_NON_GRAPHIC = 40. Then apply modifiers? None provided. So base score 40. Then severity thresholds: Mild 25-49, so severity Mild. Score 40. Rsn: we need reason string. Provide brief rationale: "Non-graphic depiction of violence." Adv: maybe "Consider adding context or reducing intensity." ok: boolean? Since it's mild, ok true? The policy says ok false only if disallowed content. This is allowed. So ok true. Suggest: null.

Return JSON: {"ans":[{"scID":34,"id":7,"det":[{"label":"VIOLENCE_NON_GRAPHIC","sev":"Mild","scr":40,"rsn":"Non-graphic depiction of violence.","adv":"Consider adding context or reducing intensity.","ok":true,"suggest":null}]}]}

Check format: JSON object with ans array. Each element has scID, id, det array. Good.

Return only JSON.<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>{"ans":[{"scID":34,"id":7,"det":[{"label":"VIOLENCE_NON_GRAPHIC","sev":"Mild","scr":40,"rsn":"Non-graphic depiction of violence.","adv":"Consider adding context or reducing intensity.","ok":true,"suggest":null}]}]}
